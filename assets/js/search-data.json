Although list1 and list2 are sorted, once they are combined, the entries may not be in alphabetical order anymore. A is the correct answer because newList is being assigned to editing of the previous newList. I did not select this answer because I overlooked that newList was the argument in some of these procedures. . The second question that I got wrong was #20. I did not select statement III because I thought that when the question said to generate a list of criminal suspects, I thought that it meant the names of the suspects. The question is actually just looking for the phone numbers of possible suspects, which is why statement III is valid. . The third question that I got wrong was #37. I got this question wrong because I thought that number of steps was related to time complexity. It is actually related to space complexity, so since the space complexity is n^2, the time complexity would be more efficient. Therefore, the algorithm would “run in a reasonable amount of time”, so the correct answer is B. .",

The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. .

            "title": "Sort Hacks",
            "content": "Bubble sort . Bubble sort compares two adjacent elements in an array. It swaps the two elements so that the smaller is on the left and the larger one is on the right. The sort then moves on to the next two elements and repeats the process. This way, the largest element will move to the end of the array. Bubble sort then repeats this process until all the elements are sorted. Since the largest element moves to the end at the end of each iteration, on the next iteration, bubble sort will ignore the last elements. This is indicated with the nested for loop: . for (int j = 0; j &lt; size - i - 1; j++) . As can be seen, j, or the index of the array, depends on the value of i. . import java.util.Arrays; public class Bubble { public static void main(String[] args) { int[] data = {1, 9, 3, 2, 5}; int size = data.length; for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; size - i - 1; j++) { int left = data[j]; int right = data[j+1]; if (right &lt; left) { int temp = left; data[j] = right; data[j+1] = temp; } } } for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) { System.out.println(data[i]); } } } Bubble.main(null) . 1 2 3 5 9 . Selection sort . In selection sort, the sorting algorithm first searches through the array to find the smallest element. The algorithm then moves that element to the front of the array. Therefore, in selection sort, the smallest element always moves to the left. . import java.util.Arrays; public class Selection { public static void main(String[] args) { int[] data = {1, 9, 3, 2, 5}; int size = data.length; for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) { int min = data[i]; int index = i; for (int j = i + 1; j &lt; size; j++) { if (min &gt; data[j]) { min = data[j]; index = j; } } int temp = data[i]; data[i] = min; data[index] = temp; } for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) { System.out.println(data[i]); } } } Selection.main(null) . 1 2 3 5 9 . Insertion . In insertion sort, the algorithm first assumes that the first element is sorted. The algorithm then moves to the next element, and compares it with the elements before. The algorithm takes the element out and stores it in a variable. The algorithm then figures out where to move the element in by comparing the element with the values of the one before. . import java.util.Arrays; public class Insertion { public static void main(String[] args) { int[] data = {1, 9, 3, 2, 5}; int size = data.length; for (int i = 1; i &lt; size; i++) { int index = 0; int num = 0; boolean swap = false; for (int j = i; j &gt; 0; j--) { num = data[i]; if (num &lt; data[j-1]) { index = j-1; swap = true; } } if (swap) { for (int k = i; k &gt; index; k--) { data[k] = data[k-1]; } data[index] = num; } } for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) { System.out.println(data[i]); } } } Insertion.main(null) . 1 2 3 5 9 . Merge sort . In merge sort, the array is split into half. This process is repeated until only one element is left per array. Next, the algorithm merges the elements together based on order. To do this, the algorithm compares the first element of each array with each other, puts the smallest element in a new array. It then moves to the next element in the array where the element was removed and comapres it with the other element in the array. This process is repeated until the new array is created that was sorted. . import java.util.Arrays; public class Merge { public Merge() { } private static void mergeSort(int[] data) { int size = data.length; if (size &lt; 2) { return; } int midIndex = size / 2; int[] leftHalf = new int[midIndex]; int[] rightHalf = new int[size - midIndex]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; midIndex; i++) { leftHalf[i] = data[i]; } for (int i = midIndex; i &lt; size; i++) { rightHalf[i - midIndex] = data[i]; } mergeSort(leftHalf); mergeSort(rightHalf); merge(data, leftHalf, rightHalf); } private static void merge(int[] data, int[] leftHalf, int[] rightHalf) { int leftSize = leftHalf.length; int rightSize = rightHalf.length; int i = 0; int j = 0; int k = 0; while (i &lt; leftSize &amp;&amp; j &lt; rightSize) { if (leftHalf[i] &lt;= rightHalf[j]) { data[k] = leftHalf[i]; i++; } else { data[k] = rightHalf[j]; j++; } k++; } while (i &lt; leftSize) { data[k] = leftHalf[i]; i++; k++; } while (j &lt; leftSize) { data[k] = rightHalf[j]; j++; k++; } } public static void printArray(int[] data) { for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++) { System.out.println(data[i]); } } public static void main(String[] args) { int[] data = {1, 9, 3, 2, 5}; mergeSort(data); printArray(data); } } Merge.main(null) . 1 2 3 5 9 . public abstract class Collectable implements Comparable &lt;Collectable&gt; { public final String masterType = &quot;Collectable&quot;; private String type; // extender should define their data type // enumerated interface public interface KeyTypes { String name(); } protected abstract KeyTypes getKey(); // this method helps force usage of KeyTypes // getter public String getMasterType() { return masterType; } // getter public String getType() { return type; } // setter public void setType(String type) { this.type = type; } // this method is used to establish key order public abstract String toString(); // this method is used to compare toString of objects public int compareTo(Collectable obj) { return this.toString().compareTo(obj.toString()); } // static print method used by extended classes public static void print(Collectable[] objs) { // print &#39;Object&#39; properties System.out.println(objs.getClass() + &quot; &quot; + objs.length); // print &#39;Collectable&#39; properties if (objs.length &gt; 0) { Collectable obj = objs[0]; // Look at properties of 1st element System.out.println( obj.getMasterType() + &quot;: &quot; + obj.getType() + &quot; listed by &quot; + obj.getKey()); } // print &quot;Collectable: Objects&#39; for(Object o : objs) // observe that type is Opaque System.out.println(o); System.out.println(); } } . /** * Implementation of a Double Linked List; forward and backward links point to adjacent Nodes. * */ public class LinkedList&lt;T&gt; { private T data; private LinkedList&lt;T&gt; prevNode, nextNode; /** * Constructs a new element * * @param data, data of object * @param node, previous node */ public LinkedList() { } public LinkedList(T data, LinkedList&lt;T&gt; node) { this.setData(data); this.setPrevNode(node); this.setNextNode(null); } /** * Clone an object, * * @param node object to clone */ public LinkedList(LinkedList&lt;T&gt; node) { this.setData(node.data); this.setPrevNode(node.prevNode); this.setNextNode(node.nextNode); } /** * Setter for T data in DoubleLinkedNode object * * @param data, update data of object */ public void setData(T data) { this.data = data; } /** * Returns T data for this element * * @return data associated with object */ public T getData() { return this.data; } /** * Setter for prevNode in DoubleLinkedNode object * * @param node, prevNode to current Object */ public void setPrevNode(LinkedList&lt;T&gt; node) { this.prevNode = node; } /** * Setter for nextNode in DoubleLinkedNode object * * @param node, nextNode to current Object */ public void setNextNode(LinkedList&lt;T&gt; node) { this.nextNode = node; } /** * Returns reference to previous object in list * * @return the previous object in the list */ public LinkedList&lt;T&gt; getPrevious() { return this.prevNode; } /** * Returns reference to next object in list * * @return the next object in the list */ public LinkedList&lt;T&gt; getNext() { return this.nextNode; } } . import java.util.Iterator; /** * Queue Iterator * * 1. &quot;has a&quot; current reference in Queue * 2. supports iterable required methods for next that returns a generic T Object */ class QueueIterator&lt;T&gt; implements Iterator&lt;T&gt; { LinkedList&lt;T&gt; current; // current element in iteration // QueueIterator is pointed to the head of the list for iteration public QueueIterator(LinkedList&lt;T&gt; head) { current = head; } // hasNext informs if next element exists public boolean hasNext() { return current != null; } // next returns data object and advances to next position in queue public T next() { T data = current.getData(); current = current.getNext(); return data; } } /** * Queue: custom implementation * @author John Mortensen * * 1.

When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is _O(1)__ because each key only has one value. If you know the key, you would know the value. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # The values of a list are outputted as part of a set. Perhaps the set only takes in unique elements # because although the list has two 2s and 1s, the set only outputs one 1 and 2. # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Sets # There can not be the same keys in sets and hashmaps. . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary. As always, documentation is always the main source for all the full capablilties. . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

Favorite Taylor Swift song . This was a hard one to choose. There are quite a few Taylor Swift songs that I like, from I Knew You Were Trouble to Blank Space to Mean. I&#39;d say that I have a favorite song for each genre of Swift&#39;s song, which is why it took a lot of contemplation to select my favorite song. In the end, I would say that my favorite Taylor Swift song is Me! firstly because of its catchy tune. One of the main things I like about her song is its message, how it empathizes accepting yourself and liking yourself because of your uniqueness. . But moreover, the reason why I like this song so much is because it showed Swift&#39;s transition from her Reputation album to Lover. I remember listening to Look What You Made Me Do when I was 11 and back then, I was pretty shocked at the lyrics. Back then, I couldn&#39;t understand what she was singing about and felt that the song was depressing. Many years later, I understand better about the pain that she communicates through that song. I remember watching Miss Americana with a friend a few years ago, and in that documentary, Swift recounted her career with how she started all the way to her producing the Lover album. The things that stuck with me the most was how much she was dealing with during the time she composed Reputation. She was struggling with anexoria, along with the burden of peparazzi and always having the desire to please her fans, even if it came at the cost of her own mental well being. I felt a lot of sympathy for her, and her documentary made her seem like a normal person. It showed that a celebrity, who typically seems to have it all, can also have a vulnerable state, and also experiences problems just like us normal people. . So after seeing her struggle through Reputation, I was happy for how she got better and moved on to creating positive, peppy songs in her Lover album. I think Me! really showed how she was embracing herself and accepting that even if she is not perfect, she is still ok with it. It felt like Swift&#39;s comeback from Reputation, and I think Me! is a perfect example of her emerging victorius from the her hardships during the Reputation era. .",

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compore create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? | . Response . Both lessons create a user. In 2.4a, the create method contains db.session.add(object), which adds to the database using SQLAlchemy. However, in 2.4b, sqlite3 is used, which adds entries into the database using sqlite3 commands. The advantages of 2.4a is that the code is easier to read since it is written in Python. The advantages of 2.4b is that OOP is not needed; however, you would need to learn SQL to be able to add entries intot eh database. | INSERT adds a row into the database. It is not the same as __init__ because __init__ is a constructor that initializes the variables. However, __init__ does not add entries into the database. The create() method does that. On the other hand, INSERT directly adds a row into the database. | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() create() . A new user record a has been created . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? | Explain try/except, when would except occur? | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? | . The hacked part checks to see if the password length is too small (1 character). If so, the program will replace the user&#39;s inputted password with its own password. | If there was an error in executing the UPDATE command, an error will be printed onto the terminal. | conn = sqlite3.connect(database), cursor = conn.cursor(), cursor.close(), and conn.close() are repeated in each example. They are needed to establish a connection with the database and to perform actions on it. | . Side note:Why does UPDATE work but not the update method in 2.4a? &gt;:( Note: as error takes the error message and stores it in the variable error. This way, you can see what the error is with print(error). It&#39;s kind of like import library as name . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

The row with user id a the password has been hacked . Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? | In the print statemements, what is the &quot;f&quot; and what does {uid} do? | . Response . DELETE can be dangerous because it is unrecoverable. | The &quot;f&quot; is the format method. This allows easier printing of variables within a string. The variable, in this case, uid, is put in curly braces so that the str() typecast is not needed. | . import sqlite3 def delete(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to delete&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM users WHERE _uid = ?&quot;, (uid,)) if cursor.rowcount == 0: # The uid was not found in the table print(f&quot;No uid {uid} was not found in the table&quot;) else: # The uid was found in the table and the row was deleted print(f&quot;The row with uid {uid} was successfully deleted&quot;) conn.commit() except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the DELETE:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() delete() .

The first picture demonstrates the debugger moving to the if statement that executes the read() function because the user inputted &quot;r&quot;. . . The second picture shows the debugger moving to the code cell with the read() function. . . CPT Work . The thing that I added to my CPT project was an API endpoint that utilized the imperative programming style, which was using the sqlite3 library to write out SQL commands. I did this instead of the OOP method since I already had that in my project. . Below is a picture of what my API endpoint looks like: . . To make the API endpoint, I first added an endpoint at the end of the code with: api.add_resource(_ReadSQL, &#39;/readsql/&lt;test&gt;. &lt;test&gt; takes in a variable in the URL. This took me some time to google, because simply searching something around the lines of api.add_resource add url variables does not give the most helpful results. However, after sifting through some webpages, I found this article, and even on this page, I had to dig really deep until I found the interesting brackets within the URL. I then incorporated it into my Flask Portfolio, took the variable in as a parameter in the get() method, and then used it in my SQL query, which ultimately worked (yay). . The second thing I learned was writing SQL queries. My endpoint takes in a user ID that the user provides and outputs their class reviews. To write this in sqlite3, my code was: select id, userID, className, difficulty, hoursOfHw, daysBtwTest, memorizationLevel, comments from classReview where id = &quot; + test. Let&#39;s break this statement down into a few pieces. First, select id, userID... means to output the contents from the column name. from classReview specifies which table to query, and where id =... retrieves the specific row where the id matches the specified keywords. In this case, the keyword is the value of test, which is specified in the API endpoint as a variable in the URL. . What I also learned was that to add Python variables into a SQL statement, add a plus sign behind the SQL command (which is in quotes which means that the command is a string) and then add the variable name. This is similar to concatenating strings with variables. .",

I did not choose the right answer because the wording in the answer of “decimal” made me believe that the input number was a decimal number, which didn’t make sense to me. After looking at the answer explanation, I understand that the method counts the number of digits in the input. This makes sense because this is a recursive function, so the method wouldn’t only reuturn 1 (what I had selected before). . I also got #35 wrong. The reason why I got this problem wrong was because I mistakenly believed that the calculations round up. When calculating the first midpoint, the result is 3.5, and I rounded to 4. Instead, you need to round down to 3, which will lead to the correct midpoint on the second iteration. . I got 39 wrong because I did not how the set method worked in System.out.println.

Wrapper classes . Wrapper classes provide a class for each primitive type in Java. For example, the wrapper class for int is Integer, char is Character, and so on. These wrapper classes extend the object class. . The syntax for a wrapper object is: wrapper class name = value; . Beware, though. Not all data types that start with a capital letter is a wrapper class. For instance, I originally thought that String was a wrapper class. After googling &quot;is String a wrapper class?&quot;, the results told me that String is not a wrapper class because it does not have a primitive class that it wraps. . Therefore, wrapper classes only wrap the eight primitive types, which means there are only eight wrapper classes. . The following cells consist of the previous primitive type examples converted into wrapper classes. . Integer[] nums = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; // regular for(int i = 0; i &lt; nums.length; i+=2) { System.out.printf(&quot;%d n&quot;, nums[i]); } . 0 2 4 6 8 . int x; int y; Double casting1; Integer casting2; x = 10; y = 15; casting1 = (double) y / x; casting2 = y / x; System.out.println(&quot;With casting: &quot; + casting1); System.out.println(&quot;With casting: &quot; + casting2); .

HELLO WORLD . Where are wrapper classes used? . One example of where wrapper classes are used is in Collection objects, such as ArrayList. ArrayList can not store primitive data types, and as such, need to be configured with wrapper classes. . ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; nums = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(); nums.add(1); nums.add(2); for (int i = 0; i &lt; nums.size(); i++) { System.out.println(nums.get(i)); } . 1 2 . . DoNothingByValue . Key knowledge . The value of arguments are passed into a method&#39;s parameters . Java is pass-by-value, not pass-by-reference for methods . If you go down the StackOverflow rabbit hole, users claim that everything in java is pass-by-value. Honestly I&#39;m not too sure how this works, but people on StackOverflow really pay close attention to detail so... | . Unfortunately I don&#39;t have enough time right now to look into it closely. I might in the future though 😃 . But basically since everything is pass-by-value, arrays are also passed-by-value. However, the value of an array is its reference. Therefore, when an array is passed into a method, the elements of the array can be changed directly. . | . | . Pass-by-value: The value of a variable is passed | Pass-by-reference: The variable&#39;s reference is passed. This allows the contents of the variable to be changed. | There can only be 1 return value per method in Java | Classes and generics allow &quot;pass-by-reference&quot; | . Overall explanation of code . This is my thought process as I went through the code. It&#39;s easier for me to figure out key knowledge by going through the entire code and documenting what it does. . Anything that I highlight below are included in the key knowledge . Do Nothings . main() . An array called nums is created and set to {1, 3, 4, 5, 5}. The data type is the primitive data type int. An int of name value is also created and set to 6. A data type (but not wrapper class) of String with name name is created and set to blackboard. The code outputs Do Nothings and executes the changeIt method, passing in nums, value, and name. . changeIt() . Within the changeIt method, the argument nums relates to the parameter arr, value to val, and name to word. arr is created to have 5 elements, val is set to 0, and word is set to a substring of the word argumenent of blackboard. As such, word is set to black. . However, before the variables are reassigned to new values, the arguments were passed into the method&#39;s parameters. For instance, if I use a for loop to output the values of arr, I get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, not 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. . . . The for loop (the actual one in the file) then assigns each element in arr to 0, and outputs it to the terminal. Lastly, the value of word (black) is outputted. . . Next thing in main() is changeIt2() . changeIt2() . In changeIt2(), the arguments are passed in as parameters of nums, value, and name. Notice how these parameters have the same name as the arguments. Based on the comment in the file, we can see that the name of the parameter can be the same as the arguments&#39; names. . changeIt2() essentially does the same thing as changeIt() . main() . What&#39;s important is that when you go back to main(), the for loop after changeIt2() outputs all of the original values of nums, value, and name. This is because Java is pass-by-value for methods, which means that the variable&#39;s values are passed into the method, NOT the reference. On the other hand, pass-by-reference allows you to edit the contents of a variable because the **reference** to the variable is passed. . Limited return . main() . An array named nums2 is assigned to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. value is assigned to 6, and name is assigned to limited. name is then assigned to the return of changeIt3() and masses in nums2 and name. . changeIt3() . Within the changeIt3() method, you can see that the parameter word (passed in as argument name) is assigned to a new String. A simplified way of writing this would be word = word.substring(0, 5). Both ways work because the shorthand for creating wrapper classes is directly assigning the class to a value; however, behind the scenes, an object is still created. . Within this method, each element of the array is modified to 0, and the word is modified to limit. . main() . Back to main() again, the elements of nums2 are printed out. The edited elements from `changeIt3()` are present because arrays are objects, and the value of an object is its reference. . Do Something with Class . At this point, I got a general understanding of what the code does, so I did not need to write out what each line does. . This section creates a DoNothingByValue object with an object name of doSomething. The constructor runs. Since the object&#39;s value is its reference, the constructor can directly edit the variables. As a result, the output in main() shows the changes of the constructor. . Do Something with Generics . This is basically the same thing as class since generics are like objects but are more general, so you can specify different data types. . IntByReference . Key Knowledge . This switches two integer numbers to lowest to highest by using a tmp variable | These variables are passed by reference because they are part of an object.

It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

To import pandas, run import pandas as pd One issue that I encountered on my flask portfolio was that the code could not find the pandas library. I tried running with pip install pandas, but that did not work either. . After some researching, I also tried running pip install -r requirements.txt. That also did not solve the issue. . I then tried running in nix-shell, and for some reason, that was successful. One hypothesis I had is that I might have needed to refresh my VS Code after running the install requirements. . Note on project: . My project was focused on providing class reviews. I recalled seeing a Google Spreadsheet on the APStudents subreddit that included student&#39;s ratings of how they felt about AP Classes. I made a copy of the spreadsheet and then took the difficulty ratings of AP CSP. . It took me a long time to find how to convert Google Sheets to JSON. I looked at multiple YouTube videos, but finally, I had to settle with using an online tool that could give me the JSON output. After importing it into my flask portfolio, I was able to use pandas to print out information of the data. .",

            "content": "The theme of our project was ciphers. Our website consists of features that include a login, an area where the user can view/change their settings, decryption, learning about ciphers, trivia, notes, and quiz. . . The parts that I worked on was the login, JWT, CRUD for users, roles, and part of the log . In the sections below, I will document what I did to create these features and some interesting things that I learned. . Login and JWT . This was the part that was the most frustrating for me. I spent around ten hours trying to get JWT to work. I kept having CORS errors, and I tried a variety of fixes such as changing Access-Control-Allow-Origin in SecurityConfig.java on the backend, and continuously editing the Nginx file. . I guess I can say that what I gained from this was really understanding the Nginx file and JWT. . In the end, I was able to fix the CORS errors by asking Mr. Mortensen. I learned that to save a cookie on the frontend, the most important thing was that you need to redirect to another page. By looking through the debugger in Chrome Dev Tools, apparently the cookie is only added in once the frontend page changes. . This is the critical piece of code on frontend: . . CRUD for users . The part that I worked a main part on this project is users, and I implemented CRUD features onto users. . First is creating users. On the login page, there is a button that allows a user to create an account: . . After that, you can create a user. Enter in an email, password, name, and birthday. I implemented error checking on the frontend through Javascript. My code checks to see the values of the password and confirm password input box, and compares them. If they are not the same, a message is displayed. . function signup() { document.getElementById(&quot;passwordMsg&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;&quot;; var password = document.getElementById(&quot;password&quot;).value; var password2 = document.getElementById(&quot;password2&quot;).value; console.log(password); console.log(password2); if (password == password2) { console.log(&quot;Match&quot;); createUser(password); } else { console.log(&quot;No match&quot;); var p = document.createElement(&quot;p&quot;); var msg = document.createTextNode(&quot;Passwords do not match. Please try again&quot;); p.appendChild(msg); document.getElementById(&quot;passwordMsg&quot;).appendChild(p); } } . A little extra research that I did was to find a way to input a valid date of birth. Clearly, no one is born in the future. Using Javascript, I created a Date object and obtained the first parts of the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format. I then set an attribute on the date input box and used the date as the max day. . As a result, the calendar looks like this: . . The backend also shows that the user that I created (username: z@gmail.com) was successfully created: . . After the user is created, you can login with the new credentials. This is what the homepage looks like, and you can see that on the right, a cookie was sucessfully created. . . . The second aspect of users that I implemented was Read. For read, I accessed the backend url of https://crimebusters.tk/api/findEmail/. This was something that I spent quite some effort in creating, because originally, I did not know how to get information from the cookie. . In the end, I used some code from JwtRequestFilter.java that obtained information from the cookie using HttpServletRequest. All I needed to get was the email. I could then search through the JpaRepository using the email and obtain the person object. With the person object, I had access to all of the information. I could then use getters to obtain user information to display on the Settings page, such as the name, birthday, and user roles. . In the image below, I circled the code in red of how I got the email and subsequently created the person object. . . . In the update section of my user, I sent a POST request to the backend to update a specific user. My code on the backend looks like this: . Optional&lt;Person&gt; person1 = repository.findById(person.getId()); //SO THIS IS THE PIECE OF CODE TO CHANGE TYPES!!!!!! Person person2 = person1.orElse(null); //debugging System.out.println(&quot;person2: &quot; + person2); //update user info only if info is provided if (person.getEmail() != null) { person2.setEmail(person.getEmail()); } if (person.getName() != null) { person2.setName(person.getName()); } if (person.getPassword() != null) { String password = person.getPassword(); password = BCrypt.hashpw(password, BCrypt.gensalt()); person2.setPassword(password); } if (person.getDob() != null) { person2.setDob(person.getDob()); } if (person.getLoginStatus() != null) { person2.setLoginStatus(person.getLoginStatus()); } return repository.save(person2); . A few things that I learned: . First of all, repository.findById(person.getId()) returns an Optional, unlike findByEmail which returns a Person object. This stumped me for awhile because I really really wanted to get the Person object since I couldn’t get information from an Optional. After StackOverflowing, I found that I could create another Person object (person2), and then use person1.orElse(null) to get the object. What’s next is basically using setters to update info onto person 2. The JpaRepository then saves this person 2 object (which is the original person object but modified), and that’s how update works! | I feel like I had something else I learned but all of a sudden I can’t remember. I’ll post here when I do remember (hopefully) (Ohhh I remember now, it had something to do with GetMapping and bad output. I’ll post about this tomorrow because it’s currently 11:28 and I want to sleep :() | . . The last thing that I have is Delete. Sending a delete request using fetch didn’t work for me, so instead, I changed my endpoint on the backend to Get, and sent a get request. . Roles . Now onto the fun stuff. Roles required me to do a lot of outside research. . First of all, the many to many relationship. The tricky part about roles is that sometimes, you want a user to have multiple roles. As a result, you can’t just make a simple roles variable and save it in the database. You need a many to many relationship (because one user can have many roles and a role can have many users). . I watched a helpful video that showed how to implement many to many in Spring Boot. . In my Person POJO: . @ManyToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL) @JoinTable( name = &quot;person_person_roles&quot;, joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = &quot;person_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;id&quot;), inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = &quot;person_role_id&quot;, referencedColumnName = &quot;id&quot;) ) private Set&lt;Personrole&gt; personrole; . In my Personroles POJO: . @ManyToMany(mappedBy = &quot;personrole&quot;, fetch = FetchType.LAZY) private Set&lt;Person&gt; person; . So anyways, at the end, my database looked like this: . . This person_personroles table is called a Join Table. Why do we need this table? The reason is because a many to many relationship actually requires two sided one to many relationships. In this example, the same person_id (29) can be mapped to different person_roles. . As a result, while z@gmail.com only has the role User, . . user a@gmail.com has both the role User and Admin. . . . Now onto the cool part. When the user is not logged in, I created an anonymous user that doesn’t have permission to access certain pages. This was achieved on the backend file of PersonDetailsService.java. By finding the role of the user through JWT, either user, admin, or anonymous role is assigned to the user: . person.getPersonrole().forEach(role -&gt; { //loop through roles //authorities.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(role.getEmail())); //create a SimpleGrantedAuthority by passed in role, adding it all to the authorities list, list of roles gets past in for spring security if (role.getRole().equals(&quot;user&quot;)) { authorities.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(&quot;ROLE_USER&quot;)); } if (role.getRole().equals(&quot;admin&quot;)) { authorities.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(&quot;ROLE_ADMIN&quot;)); } if (role.getRole().equals(&quot;anonymous&quot;)) { authorities.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority(&quot;ROLE_ANON&quot;)); } }); . Now in SecurityConfig.java, I added an antMatcher that only permits admin and users to access the log page: . .antMatchers(&quot;/api/log/getlog&quot;).hasAnyRole(&quot;ADMIN&quot;, &quot;USER&quot;) . Therefore, when I go to the logs page, I have a cookie (for the anonymous user), but there is a message telling me that I must login. . .",

For instance, Facebook is more oriented towards older people while TikTok is focused towards younger age groups. Therefore, content may be biased on these two platforms because they are more suited towards what the age group would like. Although the content may be different, it may be alright for these two platforms to be oriented towards different age groups because two different generations have different preferences and customs. Therefore, being on different platforms would allow them to access content that they are more used to. . Virtual assistants have female voices probably because they are viewed as more soothing. They may also follow typical steoreotypes. There are options to change the virtual assitant voice to a male voice, so that is good. . Algorithms are created on social media platforms in order to keep users on the website. They can find what topics the user is interested in and keep showing posts releated to that topic. . From the HP Computers video, I learned the importance of ensuring that development can be accessible to everyone. Additionally, lots of testing should be conducted in order to make sure that the product does not have any flaws and is not biased. . 5.4 Crowdsourcing . A crowdsourcing idea could be to randomly select computer science students across all AP CSP classes and conduct a survey/test. . With Del Norte, a random sample could again be selected. This ensures a sample that is more representative of the population and can reduce bias. . A data could be a feedback form that allows different people to enter of what they thought about our project. . 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns .

We should check the licenses before we use a piece of software. I think Creative Commons is the license that allows the most access to a person’s work and that making intellectual work open to people is beneficial because it can help people learn. However, I believe it is also important to allow people to retain their rights to what they have created and that credit should be given to the original creator. | Our frontend and backend repositories use the GPL-3.0 license. We chose this license because it allows people to copy the project and use it for educational purposes and learning from it. However, if they distribute it, they need to include the source code (what we made) and give us credit for it. Furthermore, they also need to release it with the GPL-3.0 license. | 5.6 Safe Computing . In our projects, we take in people’s username and password. It is important to encrypt the passwords so that these information are not accessible by a third party. | I’m not a famous person, so I don’t have that much information on the internet. However, a lot of platforms that I use probably have various information about me. This can be seen when you sign up on a website and they provide a long list of terms and agreements that probably includes a statement about how they can save your personal information and use it for various purposes. | Good passwords include a variety of characters and symbols and also upper and lowercase letters. Multifactor authentication requires multiple authentication methods, which can prevent people from logging in just because they have the password. | Symmetric key uses one key for encryption and decryption while assymetric cryptography uses a pair of public and private keys to encrypt and decrypt (different keys are used for the two processes) | When we created our fastpages, we needed to generate SSH keys (which I think uses assymetric cryptography because we generated a public and private key) | I probably encountered phishing schemes by accidently clicking on a spam email. |",

            "content": "The project that I will make for MyToolkit is MyClasses, a feature that can allow students to search for classes and see others’ review of them. . CollegeBoard Criteria . Program Purpose and Function: The purpose of the program is to help students in their course selection process. The function will be to let the student search for the class that they are interested in taking and show a list of reviews that other students have left for the class. Input will be the class that the student searches for and output will be the reviews for that class. . Data Abstraction: In my search feature, I created a list with possible class names. The name of my list is dnClasses, and the data in the list is all of the class names. This allows the search to find if the class that the student inputs exists or not, and also allows the program to see if the class that the student entered matches to the class in the list without regard to case. By ensuring that the class that the student entered is valid, the program can proceed to find class reviews on the backend and allow the student to view the reviews that they wish to see. . . . Managing complexity: The list stores all of the classes at Del Norte. This manages complexity because the program can search through the list to see if one of the classes matches the one that the student enters. Without the list, each class name would have to be stored in a variable and individually compared with the class that the student enters. . Proceduaral Abstraction: The function name is findClass(classInput). This contributes to the functionality of the program by deciding if the program should get data of the class that the student inputted on the backend or if it should output an error message. . . Algorithm Implementation: The function name is findClass(classInput). The function takes in the name of the class that the student is searching for, and repeatedly compares it to the class names in the dnClasses list to see if one of the lists matches (iteration). If there is a match (selection), the classFound boolean variable is set to true. This way, if the class was not found, an error message could be displayed in HTML on the website. Otherwise, if the class was found, the next function, getClassData, would be called. . Testing: The two calls are findClass(&quot;AP Biology&quot;) and findClass(&quot;test&quot;). The first call sends a valid class name, AP Biology. Therefore, the first section of the code is executed and the variable classFound is set to true. The second call sends an invalid class name. classFound is false, and an error message is displayed on the screen. . . The theme of our project is school. Our website consists of features that include a login, an area where the students can input their schedules, gpa, class reviews, and tasks. . . The parts that I worked on was the class review . In the sections below, I will document what I did to create these features and some interesting things that I learned. . Create . The first section is the submit review. Students can enter in a class name, difficulty, hours of homework, days between tests, memorization level, and comments. . . This sends a fetch request using POST to the backend. On the backend, I have an API endpoint called CreateClassReview. This endpoint takes in the body, which includes the username, class name, etc., and creates a ClassReview object and adds it into the database. . Read . This is the place where the student can search for a class review. On the frontend, the class that the student searches for is taken in as a variable. This variable is used to query for the class reviews that are fetched from the backend. All classes are returned from the backend; however, on the frontend, the program searches through each class name until it finds a matches. . Update . My update review consists of a section where students can edit their reviews. On the backend, the code is basically the same as my create endpoint. However, I call the update() method instead of create(), which saves the same object instead of creating a new object. . Delete . Students can also delete a class review. On the backend, the program takes in the username and class name, searches for the specific database entry that corresponds to the students’ input, and then calls the delete() method. .",

This can come in a variety of forms; for instance, people can use resources online to learn about topics that would have been very hard to access. Other people have also been able to take advantage of social media and create content that many people love. . | Those who are empowered can share their knowledge to help others. This is relevant to the digital world, because anyone can create a blog and start writing what they know. At Del Norte, we can empower each other by working together as a team so that we are able to improve together. We can also help out each other when one is confused. . | It could be possible that red tape can block digital empowerment because lots of paperwork can make things harder to accomplish. For example, in companies, paperwork is needed before something can be developed. This could hinder digital empowerment as projects need to be first approved before they can be created. . |",

            "content": "Coding: The benefits of coding include creating applications that can solve a variety of problems and help improve people’s lives. Computer programming has greatly changed our way of life and often in a good way by making tasks more convenient. However, the downside of code is that it can be utilized to exploit other systems. Coding languages such as Python and JavaScript are commonly used to compromise a system or application and steal data. . | E-books: E-books allow the process of reading to become more convenient. Because people who have devices typically carry them everywhere they go, E-books provide the opportunity to read anywhere. This saves the weight of carrying a book that may be bulky. E-books also helps save trees as no paper is required for a digital book. The downside of E-books is that it increases the amount of screen time that people are exposed to. Especially in a time when we are increasing our device usage time, E-books are another contribution to this. . | Robots: The benefits of robots are that they can be used to either do tasks that simplify a person’s life, or they can be used to do tasks that would be extremely difficult or impossible for a person to do. The danger of robots is that if robots are programmed with AI, there could be potential dangers. This can be seen in movies where robots destroy the human civilization because they have a mind of their own. . | . I agree that games and social media can become very addictive. After all, these forms of entertainment are intentionally developed to capture a person’s attention and keep them on the media. For example, social media is filled with algorithms that identify a person’s interests and select posts and advertisements that align with it. This keeps users on the platform for an extremely long period of time as they scroll away endlessly. In addition, games are also addictive in that they allow people to escape from their real life struggles and immerse themselves in a world in which they can be the hero. The tasks in games are also achievable, providing the dopamine rush that many people desperately crave. This can be dangerous because these media often worsen a person’s escapism, because they can be the person they can not achieve in real life. |",

I got #32 wrong because it made sense to me that lenCount had to reset if the elements were not consecutive anymore. However, I failed to realize that if lenCount was not larger than maxLen, lenCount still needed to be reset, which would not have been the case by selecting D. . No context for #36. . I answered wrong on #50 because I did not realize that i &lt; num1 would mean that 10 is excluded. Therefore, to print 10, the correct answer would be D, which used 20 as the bound. .

This is an interesting point to take note of, because the connotation of function and purpose are quite similar. However, College Board’s standards explain that the “purpose must address the problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program.” | .

Notes . Code that performs the same task can have a different amount of time that it runs | The more functions you add, the more time it takes to run the code For example, an add function that converts toint and then tostr will take up more seconds than a function that merely adds the functions and returns the value to a print statement (because a print statement can print an integer if that is the only value) | Polynomial creates the least cycles (ex: 3x and (2x)^2) vs exponential which creates more cycles (ex: 3^x) | . .

Real life example: Internet connections time out if a website does not load . Homework! . Make an algorithm that finds the fastest route that hits every location once starting and ending at Del Norte. Make sure to show your thinking. If you are strugling, try using a huristic approach. Remember, what matters more than having perfectly functioning code is that you tried your hardest. . dataset = { &#39;DelNorte&#39;:{ &#39;Westview&#39;:15, &#39;MtCarmel&#39;:20, &#39;Poway&#39;:35, &#39;RanchoBernardo&#39;:50 }, &#39;Westview&#39;:{ &#39;DelNorte&#39;:15, &#39;MtCarmel&#39;:35, &#39;Poway&#39;:25, &#39;RanchoBernardo&#39;: 45 }, &#39;MtCarmel&#39;:{ &#39;Westview&#39;:35, &#39;DelNorte&#39;:20, &#39;Poway&#39;:40, &#39;RanchoBernardo&#39;:30 }, &#39;Poway&#39;:{ &#39;Westview&#39;:25, &#39;MtCarmel&#39;:40, &#39;DelNorte&#39;:35, &#39;RanchoBernardo&#39;:15 }, &#39;RanchoBernardo&#39;:{ &#39;Westview&#39;:45, &#39;MtCarmel&#39;:30, &#39;Poway&#39;:15, &#39;DelNorte&#39;:50 } } . Ver 1 . I don&#39;t know how to make the most efficient algorithm to find the best path. This is my code below, which uses nested for loops to find the shortest route to each location (while making sure that they haven&#39;t been reached yet). I also have multiple attempts below that worked and did not work to show that I did try many times (took me 2 hours to figure out lol) . def fastestroute(start,data): drivetime = 0 order = [] #CODE,CODE,CODE order.append(start) travelPlace2 = start for i in range (len(dataset) - 1): shortestTime = 100 travelPlace = travelPlace2 for j in range(len(dataset[travelPlace])): if list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] &lt; shortestTime: if list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] not in order: shortestTime = list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] travelPlace2 = list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] else: continue order.append(travelPlace2) drivetime += shortestTime drivetime += dataset[travelPlace2][&quot;DelNorte&quot;] start = &#39;DelNorte&#39; data = dataset fastestroute(start, data) print(&quot;The route is: &quot; + str(order)) print(&quot;Total time is: &quot; + str(drivetime)) # &#39;dataset&#39; is the name of the nested key value pair .

This was actually my original attempt, which also works but is more inefficient because I copy pasted the for loop to find the shortest route to the locations multiple times. In the version above, I used a nested for loop so that I could reuse the same cold multiple times. . drivetime = 0 def fastestroute(start,data): global drivetime drivetime = 0 global order order = [] #CODE,CODE,CODE order.append(start) travelPlace2 = start shortestTime = 100 travelPlace = travelPlace2 for j in range(len(dataset[travelPlace])): if list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] &lt; shortestTime: if list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] not in order: shortestTime = list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] travelPlace2 = list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] else: continue order.append(travelPlace2) drivetime += shortestTime print(order) print(travelPlace2) shortestTime = 100 travelPlace = travelPlace2 for j in range(len(dataset[travelPlace])): if list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] &lt; shortestTime: if list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] not in order: shortestTime = list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] travelPlace2 = list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] else: continue order.append(travelPlace2) drivetime += shortestTime print(order) print(travelPlace2) shortestTime = 100 travelPlace = travelPlace2 for j in range(len(dataset[travelPlace])): if list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] &lt; shortestTime: if list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] not in order: shortestTime = list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] travelPlace2 = list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] else: continue order.append(travelPlace2) drivetime += shortestTime print(order) print(travelPlace2) shortestTime = 100 travelPlace = travelPlace2 for j in range(len(dataset[travelPlace])): if list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] &lt; shortestTime: if list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] not in order: shortestTime = list(dataset[travelPlace].values())[j] travelPlace2 = list(dataset[travelPlace].keys())[j] else: continue order.append(travelPlace2) drivetime += shortestTime print(order) print(travelPlace2) print(drivetime) drivetime += dataset[travelPlace2][&#39;DelNorte&#39;] print(drivetime) start = &#39;DelNorte&#39; data = dataset fastestroute(start, data) # &#39;dataset&#39; is the name of the nested key value pair .

            "title": "CompSci/Technical Business Panel",
            "content": "Takeaways . Today’s panel featured two speakers, Kathyleen Beveridge and Kris Porter, who talked about their journey in the field of project management and software engineering. One thing that struck out to me in this event was the importance of computer science and how it is applicable to many other fields, such as business/finance. As senior director of marketing, Kathyleen spends time communicating with developers to create products that customers would want. This brings me to the next point that I found really interesting, which is that the similarities between HP, Qualcomm, and Thermo Fisher Scientific is that all of them serve to help create technology and products that will help people (as can be seen in their mission statements). I think this is really cool because this means that as a software engineer, you get to be part of the effort that helps improve the lives of people around the world. Something else that really stood out to me was Kris’s emphasis of continuous learning. I think this is especially relevant because our modern world is extremely fast paced, and to be caught up, it’s necessary to keep learning and growing in knowledge, especially in programming when things are continuously changing and inventions are rapidly being produced. Besides, it’s also fun to learn new things ;). Altogether, today’s panel allowed me to learn about software engineering in the real world and what to expect in the workplace. . Notes that I took during the event . Speaker: Kathyleen Beveridge . Santa Clara university (bachelor), MBA at USC | Maya Angelou: My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. | Investment banker at Wells Fargo, stock broker -&gt; switched to high tech at HP, then to Qualcomm, then Thermo Fisher Scientific (biotech) | Similarities in mission statements between companies: Creating technology, products, and services that helps people and creating what people around the world want | Qualcomm chips were in 99% cell phones in the world | Developing product goes through stages before commercialization Ask for voice of sales, voice of customers | . Speaker: Kris Porter . Software Engineer: SRE, DevOps, Infrastructure engineer | UCLA in Electrical Engineering | Researched Embedded Networked Sensors, opened up software engineering (learned Linux) | Worked at startup with email marketing automation, working as DevOps | Then worked at NBC Universal, streaming media infrastructure | Qualcomm for six years, DevOps, automation, monitoring | Work at Twitter, work on GraphQL | Spent time in securing networks | Emphasize continous learning: CCNA, Machine learning and deep learning, Python, Data structure, Algorithm and System Design (for interview), Twitter University | Projects: Streaming media infrastructure, analytics infrastructure (LocationSmart at Qualcomm), add GraphQL component at data centers at Twitter Moving REST API to GraphQL | . Q &amp; A: . Agile methodology: Technical: Different companies have different versions of Agile For example: Qualcomm: Planned work in 2-3 days meeting, created a roadmap for any project Sprints: Plan what you can do in a shorter amount of time (ex: 1 month) Very important skillset for tech | Python, Machine Learning framework: TensorFlow | GitLab with 100k repositories, using machine learning algorithm to figure out downloads | Nontechnical: Data scientist: Join frontend database to predict customer demand and sales Example: Use database to predict demand during vaccine orders | Most important skill to have in tech industry? Continuous learning (learning how to learn), you will probably learn a new programming language at each company you work for Don’t worry about what you see on the news . Be adaptable, life can be like a zigzag path . | Biggest challenge in tech industry + how overcome? Silicon Valley tech interviews: Timed random tests: Solve a problem in 30-45 min, code should compile . | Twitter University? Formal training of systems because things built are private Learn to navigate through the code . | How will learning to code help in business? Coding teaches you how to problem solve and critical thinking, why did you reach the conclusion that you did? . | Interested in learning/exploring? Web3, AWS, Google Cloud . | How coding help in investment/finance? Algorithms and patterns can help with stock | .",

What number would you like to convert to decimal? 25 25 converted to binary is: 00011001 . Notes . Recursive method: Method that calls itself repeatedly . Consists of two parts: Base case and recursive call | Base case: The value that is returned when the recursion stops | . Recursive methods use a call stack that keeps track of the recursive function being called until the base case is reached. . Difference between recursion and iteration . Iteration executes code through a loop (ex: for loop, while loop), while recursion uses function calls . Binary search . The most important thing about binary search is that the data must be sorted i.e. from least to greatest. Binary search is more efficient than linear search. . Linear recursion is when a function calls itself only once. An example is shown below. . import java.util.Scanner; public class Demo { public static int addNumAndConst(int num1, int num2) { if (num1 == 1 &amp;&amp; num2 == 0) { return num1 + num2; } return num1 + num2 + addNumAndConst(1, 0); } public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(addNumAndConst(5, 3)); } } Demo.main(null) . 9 . Selection sort finds the minimum element and attaches it to the sorted part. . Merge sort divides the array into two halves and repeatedly does so. The merge() function is then used to merge them together. .",

            "title": "Unit 3.14 Libraries Lesson",
            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . Summary (comprehensive notes are below) . Library: Allows the user to import methods that can perform functions that would be complicated to code The entire package can be imported or just a single method from the package. To import a single method from a package, type from package name import method name . | Import a library as a user provided name: import name as user input name . | To import all methods from a library, type from name import * . | . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word front, followed by the package name, then the word import, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use *. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word as, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import numpy from numpy import sqrt import numpy as np . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python python library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | return next highest integer (ex: 10.1 -&gt; 11) | . floor(x) | rounds to largest integer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial | . gcd(x,y) | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y, no decimals | . lcm(x,y) | returns the least common multiple of x and y | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * print(&quot;Enter 1st number&quot;) num1 = float(input(&quot;Enter 1st number&quot;)) print(num1) print(&quot;Enter 2nd number&quot;) num2 = float(input(&quot;Enter 2nd number&quot;)) print(num2) print(&quot;Number 1 rounded up: &quot; + str(ceil(num1))) print(&quot;Number 2 rounded up: &quot; + str(ceil(num2))) print(&quot;Number 1 rounded down: &quot; + str(floor(num1))) print(&quot;Number 2 rounded down: &quot; + str(floor(num2))) print(&quot;LCM: &quot; + str(lcm(floor(num1), floor(num2)))) print(&quot;GCM: &quot; + str(gcd(ceil(num1), ceil(num2)))) print(&quot;Factorial of num1: &quot; + str(factorial(floor(num1)))) print(&quot;Factorial of num2: &quot; + str(factorial(floor(num2)))) print(&quot;Square root of 1: &quot; + str(sqrt(num1))) #print(&quot;Number 1 rounded up: &quot; + str()) . Enter 1st number 1.2 Enter 2nd number 2.6 Number 1 rounded up: 2 Number 2 rounded up: 3 Number 1 rounded down: 1 Number 2 rounded down: 2 LCM: 2 GCM: 1 Factorial of num1: 1 Factorial of num2: 2 Square root of 1: 1.0954451150103321 . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . Option 1 . Option 2 . from datetime import date import datetime import random days_dictionary = { 1: 31, 2: 28, 3: 31, 4: 30, 5: 31, 6: 30, 7: 31, 8: 31, 9: 30, 10: 31, 11: 30, 12: 31, } month1 = random.choice(list(days_dictionary.keys())) day1Max = days_dictionary.get(month1) day1 = random.randint(1, day1Max) year1 = input(&quot;year&quot;) print(&quot;random day: &quot; + str(month1) + &quot;/&quot; + str(day1) + &quot;/&quot; + str(year1)) month2 = random.choice(list(days_dictionary.keys())) day2Max = days_dictionary.get(month2) day2 = random.randint(1, day2Max) print(&quot;random day: &quot; + str(month2) + &quot;/&quot; + str(day2) + &quot;/&quot; + str(year1)) datetime1 = datetime.datetime(int(year1), int(month1), int(day1)) datetime2 = datetime.datetime(int(year1), int(month2), int(day2)) global diffDay diffDay = str(datetime2 - datetime1) diffDay = int(diffDay.partition(&quot;,&quot;)[0].partition(&quot;days&quot;)[0]) if int(diffDay) &lt; 0: diffDay *= -1 print(&quot;The number of days between the given range of dates is: &quot; + str(diffDay) + &quot; days&quot;) . random day: 1/13/2000 random day: 4/12/2000 The number of days between the given range of dates is: 90 days .",

An example is that an IP address consists of four bytes, each separated by a decimal. A decimal number can also be expressed in binary as a byte. . | Hexadecimal: Uses base 16 Hexadecimal numbers range from 0-9, and the remaining six digits are in letters (A = 10, B = 11, C, D, E, F, etc.) . | Unsigned integer: Nonnegative integer, while a signed integer can be both positive and negative. . Unsigned integer can be represented in regular binary . To represent a signed integer, add another digit in front of the binary number. The digit is either 0 or 1, with 0 being positive and 1 being negative. . For example, +6 is 0110 in binary, while -6 is 1110 . | Floating point: Decimal numbers are approximated by binary fractions. Many different decimal numbers may share the same binary fraction. Therefore, rounding errors can occur sometimes when performing Python calculations. . | ASCII: A character encoding (American) . | Unicode: International encoding standard for text | RGB: Contains views for red, blue, and green, range from 0-255 | . Lossy permanently deletes certain information, while lossless does not. . . Variables: Abstractions that store values (numbers, boolean values, strings) Variables are categorized based on data type, which typically includes: integer, double/float, string, and booleans. | List: Contains elements | Dictionaries: Consist of key value pairs | . The homework example above demonstrates the use of lists and variables in Python. The album and song variable takes in a string input which is converted into an integer. The album list consists of lists and tuples, which are used to separate albums and songs. . Python . Variables . Assigning variables: variable name = value . Why use variables? . Variables help to manage complexity by storing values. They can have descriptive names that indicate what the variable does. Furthermore, variables can be reused throughout the program, and if the value needs to be changed, only the variable assignment needs to be changed, while the rest of the code can remain the same. . Lists . Assigning a list to a variable example: myList = [1, 2, 3] . Add elements to a list with: list.append(element) . Dictionaries . Create a dictionary with this syntax: dictionary name = {key:value} . Algorithm: A set of instructions to do a certain task . Selection: Determines which parts of codes are ran based on if they evaluate to true or false. Used with if statements. . Conditional: Different code statements are executed based of if they evaluate to true or false (boolean expressions (See 3.5)) . Conditionals . Below is an example of an if else statement that relates to binary . This should be pretty straightforward in demonstrating what an if statement is, so I&#39;m not going to do a code example for an if statement. Check the code cell below the next to see an example of a elif. . binaryString = input(&quot;Enter your binary string in 8 digits&quot;) if binaryString[0:1] == 1: print(&quot;Your binary number is greater than or equal to 128&quot;) else: print(&quot;Your binary number is less than 128&quot;) . Your binary number is less than 128 . weather = &quot;rainy&quot; if weather == &quot;sunny&quot;: print(&quot;Remember to bring a hat&quot;) elif weather == &quot;windy&quot;: print(&quot;Go fly a kite!&quot;) else: print(&quot;Remember to bring an umbrella&quot;) . Remember to bring an umbrella . Sequencing: The order in which an algorithm runs. . Selection: Algorithms figure out whether to execute a boolean statement (if statement) . Iteration: Loop (ex: for, while) . See here for a coding example demonstrating sequencing, selection, and iteration. . Coding example . The code below converts a decimal number into binary. This demonstrates sequencing, selection, and iteration. . Sequencing: First, the binary numbers are appended to the binary list. Next, each binary number is subtracted from the inputted decimal number provided that the input number &gt; the binary number. If that is the case, a &quot;1&quot; will be added to the binary string; otherwise, a &quot;0&quot; will be added. | Selection: The if statement determines if a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot; is added to the binary string. | Iteration: Two for loops are present; the first adds binary numbers to the list and the second adds a 1 or a 0 to the binary string. | . Furthermore, this code segment demonstrates concatenating strings. As you can see in the example below, the output string is either appended to 1 or 0 depending on if the power of 2 fits in the number. . def convert(num): numOfBinary = 8 binary = []; output = &quot;&quot; for i in range(numOfBinary): binary.append((2**(numOfBinary - 1 - i))) for i in range(len(binary)): if num - binary[i] &gt;= 0: num -= binary[i] output += &quot;1&quot; else: output += &quot;0&quot; print(output) convert(25) . 00011001 . Expressions . Expressions are values that can be combined to be interpreted into a new value. . The usual mathematical symbols apply, the main difference is that the symbol for exponents is **, not ^. . The coding example here demonstrates how to use the ** (exponent). . Booleans . Booleans have 2 values: True and False. . Note: All of the code cells on this blog demonstrate boolean expressions and selections. Check a JavaScript version to see boolean expressions and iteration. . Relational Operators . ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= . Relational/comparison operators can compare numbers, but they can also be used to compare strings. The later a letter is, the greater its value. . For example, as you can see in the code below, print(b &gt; a) outputs as true, because in alphabetical order, b is after a. . a = &quot;a&quot; b = &quot;b&quot; print(b &gt; a) . True . Logical operators . and, or, not . In Python, and is &amp;&amp;, or is ||, and not is ! . x = 5 y = 5 z = 3 if x == 5 and y == 5: print(&quot;x and y are equal to 5&quot;) if x == 5 or z == 5: print(&quot;Either x or z is equal to 5&quot;) if not x == 3: print(&quot;x is not equal to 3&quot;) . x and y are equal to 5 Either x or z is equal to 5 x is not equal to 3 . . You can create truth tables with logical operators. . A truth table lists all the possible True/False values that two booleans (P and Q is the convention) can take. These True/False values are then used to evaluate a third expression to see if all cases are true. . An example below is an application of DeMorgan&#39;s Law. . def checkDeMorgans(): if not a or not b == (not (a and b)): print(&quot;DeMorgan&#39;s Law is true&quot;) a = True b = True checkDeMorgans() a = False b = True checkDeMorgans() a = True b = False checkDeMorgans() a = False b = False checkDeMorgans() . DeMorgan&#39;s Law is true DeMorgan&#39;s Law is true DeMorgan&#39;s Law is true DeMorgan&#39;s Law is true . Strings . Psuedocode: Using common language to write out code. Good for planning purposes and helps other people understand what you intend to do with the code. . Index: Represents the position of an array. . Length: How long something is. For example, the length of a string is the number of characters it has. . Python . Length: len(value you want to find length of) . Substring syntax in Python: string[start index:end index - 1] . In this code, the substring takes an individual character from the binary string and calculates its values based on the base two power place it is in. . This can show specific characters in a string, which are the individual letters/numbers. . Below is an example of traversing through a string. . message = &quot;StRiNG&quot; for i in range(0, len(message)): print(message[i]) . S t R i N G . You can also change a string to uppercase or lowercase with the upper() and lower functions. . msg = &quot;dEfaUlt stRinG&quot; print(msg) print(msg.upper() + &quot; now uppercase&quot;.upper()) print(msg.lower() + &quot; now lowercase&quot;.lower()) . dEfaUlt stRinG DEFAULT STRING NOW UPPERCASE default string now lowercase . Nested Conditionals . Nested conditionals are essentially conditionals within conditionals. . Below is an example of nested if statements in Python . num = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) print(&quot;Enter a number: &quot; + str(num)) if num &gt; 0: print(&quot;Your number is positive&quot;) if num &gt; 50: print(&quot;Your number is also greater than 50&quot;) else: print(&quot;Your number is negative&quot;) if num &lt; -50: print(&quot;Your number is also less than -50&quot;) . Enter a number: 60 Your number is positive Your number is also greater than 50 . Use iteration to simplify your code and to prevent manually repeating code over and over again. . Iteration: . While loop: while condition: . See the code cell below for an example of iterating through a list using a while loop. . myList = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;oranges&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;] i = 0 while i &lt; len(myList): print(myList[i]) i += 1 . apples oranges bananas . break . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(i) if i == 3: break i+= 1 . 0 1 2 3 . Procedural abstraction . Procedural abstraction provides a name for a task without showing what the actual task does, ex: a function . def addNum(num1, num2): return num1 + num2 sum = addNum(5, 3) print(sum) . 8 . Lists . Lists: Collections that store data, can use loops to iterate through them | . Python: list name = [element 1 , element 2 ] . Index: Specify the location where a list element is found, usually starts at 0 Note: In AP CSP, list indexes start at 1 | . Example: myList = [0, 1, 2] . print(myList[0]) will output 0 . Below is an example of using different methods for lists: . myList = [1, 2, 3] print(&quot;Element at index 1 in myList: &quot; + str(myList[1])) var1 = myList[0] print(&quot;Value of var1 (element at index 0) &quot; + str(var1)) myList.insert(1, 1.5) print(&quot;Inserting 1.5 into list at index 1... &quot; + str(myList)) myList.append(4) print(&quot;Adding the value 4: &quot; + str(myList)) myList.remove(4) myList.remove(1) print(&quot;Removing element 1 and 4... &quot; + str(myList)) . Element at index 1 in myList: 2 Value of var1 (element at index 0) 1 Inserting 1.5 into list at index 1... [1, 1.5, 2, 3] Adding the value 4: [1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4] Removing element 1 and 4... [1.5, 2, 3] . Iteration: . While loop: while condition: . See the code cell below for an example of iterating through a list using a while loop. . myList = [&quot;apples&quot;, &quot;oranges&quot;, &quot;bananas&quot;] i = 0 while i &lt; len(myList): print(myList[i]) i += 1 . apples oranges bananas . For loop (iterate through lists): for element name in list name: . Recursive loop: Recursive loops call themselves by calling the function name again . Note: Don&#39;t do the code below, will run forever . def recursive_function(): recursive_function . . You can put a dictionary in a list, below is an example: . Note: When you are printing a dictionary by its key, specify the key name in brackets []. . Example: myList = {&quot;myKey&quot;:&quot;myValue&quot;}, to print out the value, do: print(myList[&quot;myKey&quot;]) . myList = [{1: &quot;red&quot;, 2: &quot;blue&quot;}, {1: &quot;purple&quot;, 2: &quot;green&quot;}] print(&quot;Printing the first dictionary in myList: &quot; + str(myList[0])) print(&quot;Printing the second dictionary in myList: &quot; + str(myList[1])) print(&quot;Printing the second key in the first dictionary in myList: &quot; + str(myList[0][2])) . Printing the first dictionary in myList: {1: &#39;red&#39;, 2: &#39;blue&#39;} Printing the second dictionary in myList: {1: &#39;purple&#39;, 2: &#39;green&#39;} Printing the second key in the first dictionary in myList: blue . Procedures . Procedure: Programming instructions, can have parameters/return values . | Parameters: The input value in a procedure/function . | Arguments: The values of the parameters when they are called. . | Modularity: Separating functions into many pieces for better organization and to decompose a larger problem so that many parts of the code work to perform one function. . | Procedural Abstraction: Gives a name (tells you what the task does) but does not show how a task is done. It takes in parameters and may execute different statements (selection) depending on the parameter. It is used to decompose a large problem by providing a solution to a smaller problem. . | . Calling Procedures . Procedure call interrupts the code and executes the code inside the procedure. After that finishes, the program moves back to where it originally was when it called the procedure. . A procedure may return a value, but it does not need to do so . Calling a procedure: procedure name(arguments) . Developing Procedures . When making a procedure, make sure to do the following: . Give the procedure a descriptive name | Note what parameters are needed | Note any required data | Determine if the procedure returns a value or just simply does something | . JavaScript notes . function name(parameters) {}: Creates a function . . Library: Allows the user to import methods that can perform functions that would be complicated to code The entire package can be imported or just a single method from the package. To import a single method from a package, type from package name import method name . | Import a library as a user provided name: import name as user input name . | To import all methods from a library, type from name import * . | . . Packages example: numpy, datetime, turtle . Math . Below is an example of using the math package . from math import * print(&quot;Enter 1st number&quot;) num1 = float(input(&quot;Enter 1st number&quot;)) print(num1) print(&quot;Enter 2nd number&quot;) num2 = float(input(&quot;Enter 2nd number&quot;)) print(num2) print(&quot;Number 1 rounded up: &quot; + str(ceil(num1))) print(&quot;Number 2 rounded up: &quot; + str(ceil(num2))) print(&quot;Number 1 rounded down: &quot; + str(floor(num1))) print(&quot;Number 2 rounded down: &quot; + str(floor(num2))) print(&quot;LCM: &quot; + str(lcm(floor(num1), floor(num2)))) print(&quot;GCM: &quot; + str(gcd(ceil(num1), ceil(num2)))) print(&quot;Factorial of num1: &quot; + str(factorial(floor(num1)))) print(&quot;Factorial of num2: &quot; + str(factorial(floor(num2)))) print(&quot;Square root of 1: &quot; + str(sqrt(num1))) #print(&quot;Number 1 rounded up: &quot; + str()) . Enter 1st number 1.3 Enter 2nd number 2.5 Number 1 rounded up: 2 Number 2 rounded up: 3 Number 1 rounded down: 1 Number 2 rounded down: 2 LCM: 2 GCM: 1 Factorial of num1: 1 Factorial of num2: 2 Square root of 1: 1.140175425099138 . Below is an example that utilizes the random library . import random print(random.randint(1, 10)) # prints a random number between 1 and 10 . 8 . Simulations: Abstractions that mimic things that occur in the real world, you can use simulations to calculate things that you can&#39;t test in the real world May contain bias because some real world elements can not be factored in Use random number generators to simulate randomness and variability. Applications: Rolling a dice, flipping a coin, spinners . | Random number generator: You can use the random library: import random . | . Problem: Decision Problem: A problem with yes/no answer | Organization Problem: A problem with the goal of finding a best answer | . | Instance: Problem with specific input | Efficiency: How much computing you need for a problem to be resolved Polynomial Efficiency (Good): Proportional amount of time (linear) the more work you do | Exponential Efficiency (Bad): Exponential amount of time the more work you do (ex: double the amount of time) | . | Heuristic Approach: Finding a more efficient optimal solution | Decidable Problem: A decision problem with a solution that always outputs correctly | Undecidable Problem: A decision problem with no solution | .",

Additionally, Complete and send a screenshot of your code for 2017 FRQ Q4: Successor Array in that same google form. . Please submit as a pair or group. . 2017 FRQ #4a . 1st attempt . public static Position findPosition(int num, int[][] intArr) { for (int row = 0; row &lt; intArr.length; row++) { for (int col = 0; col &lt; intArr[row].length; col++) { if (intArr[row][col] == num) { return } } } return null; } . Comments . I graded my first attempt a 4/5 because I did not know how to return an object since the method type is of class Position. The way to do so is: return new Position(row, col);, which returns a Position object with the row and column location of the number. Below is my correction: . public static Position findPosition(int num, int[][] intArr) { for (int row = 0; row &lt; intArr.length; row++) { for (int col = 0; col &lt; intArr[row].length; col++) { if (intArr[row][col] == num) { return new Position(row, col); // correction } } } return null; } . 4b . 1st attempt . public static Position[][] getSuccessorArray(int[][] intArr) { Position[][] arr = {}; for (int row = 0; row &lt; intArr.length; row++) { for (int col = 0; col &lt; intArr[row].length; col++) { arr[row][col] = findPosition(intArr[row][col] + 1, intArr); } } return arr; } . Comments . I graded my first attempt a 3/4 because I did not create the 2D array correctly. Since the successor array has the same dimension as the integer array, the dimensions of the successor array needed to be specified with Position[][] arr = new Position[intArr.length][intArr[0].length];. Below is my correction. . public static Position[][] getSuccessorArray(int[][] intArr) { Position[][] arr = new Position[intArr.length][intArr[0].length]; // correction for (int row = 0; row &lt; intArr.length; row++) { for (int col = 0; col &lt; intArr[row].length; col++) { arr[row][col] = findPosition(intArr[row][col] + 1, intArr); } } return arr; } . . int height = 3; int spaceCounter = 0; int leafCounter = 0; int trunkSpace = height - 1; String[][] tree = new String[height][2*(2*height-1)-1]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; tree.length; i++) { leafCounter = 0; int maxLeaf = i * 2 + 1; for (int j = 0; j &lt; tree[i].length; j++) { if (j &lt; (2*(height - 1 - i))) { tree[i][j] = &quot; &quot;; } else if (j % 2 == 0 &amp;&amp; leafCounter &lt; maxLeaf) { tree[i][j] = &quot;*&quot;; leafCounter++; } else if (j % 2 != 0 &amp;&amp; leafCounter &lt; maxLeaf) { tree[i][j] = &quot; &quot;; } else { tree[i][j] = &quot; &quot;; } } } for (int i = 0; i &lt; tree.length; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; tree[i].length; j++) { System.out.print(tree[i][j]); } System.out.println(); } . * * * * * * * * * . import java.util.Scanner; Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); System.out.println(&quot;How tall would you like your tree to be?&quot;); int height = input.nextInt(); System.out.println(height); int leafCounter = 0; int trunkSpace = height - 1; String[][] tree = new String[height + height - 1][2*(2*height-1)-1]; for (int i = 0; i &lt; tree.length - (height-1); i++) { leafCounter = 0; int maxLeaf = i * 2 + 1; for (int j = 0; j &lt; tree[i].length; j++) { if (j &lt; (2*(height - 1 - i))) { tree[i][j] = &quot; &quot;; } else if (j % 2 == 0 &amp;&amp; leafCounter &lt; maxLeaf) { tree[i][j] = &quot;*&quot;; leafCounter++; } else { tree[i][j] = &quot; &quot;; } } } for (int i = tree.length - (height-1); i &lt; tree.length; i++) { int maxLeaf = 3; leafCounter = 0; for (int j = 0; j &lt; tree[i].length; j++) { if (j &lt; 2 * height - 1 -3) { tree[i][j] = &quot; &quot;; } else if (j % 2 == 0 &amp;&amp; leafCounter &lt; maxLeaf) { tree[i][j] = &quot;*&quot;; leafCounter++; } else { tree[i][j] = &quot; &quot;; } } } for (int i = 0; i &lt; tree.length; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; tree[i].length; j++) { System.out.print(tree[i][j]); } System.out.println(); } .

            "content": "Homework/Hacks . our homework we have decided for a decimal number to binary converter. You must use conditional statements within your code and have a input box for where the decimal number will go. This will give you a 2.7 out of 3 and you may add anything else to the code to get above a 2.7. . Below is an example of decimal number to binary converter which you can use as a starting template. . . I added an input to take in a decimal number to convert to binary . def DecimalToBinary(num): strs = &quot;&quot; while num: # if (num &amp; 1) = 1 if (num &amp; 1): strs += &quot;1&quot; # if (num &amp; 1) = 0 else: strs += &quot;0&quot; # right shift by 1 num &gt;&gt;= 1 return strs # function to reverse the string def reverse(strs): print(strs[::-1]) # Driver Code num = int(input(&quot;Enter num&quot;)) print(&quot;Binary of num &quot; + str(num) + &quot; is:&quot;, end=&quot; &quot;) reverse(DecimalToBinary(num)) . Binary of num 32 is: 100000 . Below are some other versions of a decimal to binary converter that I made. . Version #1 . This version creates a list that stores the powers of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^7). Each number in the list is subtracted from the input decimal number if the decimal number is larger, and 1s and 0s are added accordingly to the binary string based on if the power of 2 is subtracted or not. . def convert(num): numOfBinary = 8 binary = []; output = &quot;&quot; for i in range(numOfBinary): binary.append((2**(numOfBinary - 1 - i))) for i in range(len(binary)): if num - binary[i] &gt;= 0: num -= binary[i] output += &quot;1&quot; else: output += &quot;0&quot; return output; num = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) print(str(num) + &quot; in binary is: &quot; + convert(num)) . 32 in binary is: 00100000 .

Variables: Abstractions that store values (numbers, boolean values, strings) Variables are categorized based on data type, which typically includes: integer, double/float, string, and booleans. | List: Contains elements | Dictionaries: Consist of key value pairs | . The homework example above demonstrates the use of lists and variables in Python. The album and song variable takes in a string input which is converted into an integer. The album list consists of lists and tuples, which are used to separate albums and songs. . Python . Variables . Assigning variables: variable name = value . Why use variables? . Variables help to manage complexity by storing values. They can have descriptive names that indicate what the variable does. Furthermore, variables can be reused throughout the program, and if the value needs to be changed, only the variable assignment needs to be changed, while the rest of the code can remain the same. . Lists . Assigning a list to a variable example: myList = [1, 2, 3] . Add elements to a list with: list.append(element) . Dictionaries . Create a dictionary with this syntax: dictionary name = {key:value} . JavaScript . Variables . Defining variables: . var variable name = value | const variable name = value | let variable name = value | . Boolean . Receive a true/false output from a boolean with: Boolean(conditional) . List . const list name = [elements] . Newlines can also be used in a list for increased readability: . const name = [ element 1, element 2 ] . . 3.2 Data Abstraction . Data abstraction: Simplifies code by hiding unnecessary information. An example of using data abstraction is lists, which are able to store multiple values. Lists can be more useful than variables in that you can have one list that stores multiple values which would otherwise have needed multiple variables to store them. | . Python . Lists .

            "content": "Explanation of code . Files overview . There are 3 files: APCalendar.java, Year.java, and CalendarApiController.java. APCalendar.java contains the methods that provide the functions of the calendar, Year.java is the POJO to get information from the APCalendar class, and CalendarApiController.java controls the REST API. . How the code works . Calendar data can be accessed through the URI. The endpoints are specified with @GetMapping in CalendarApiController.java. Within each endpoint, a Year object is created and the setYear method is called. Within the Year class, you can see which setters are called. These setters then call methods in the APCalendar class, which are programmed to output things such as if a given year is a leap year, the day of the week of a day, how many days since January 1st a given day of the year is, etc. . . What I learned . Within the APCalendar class, there were many methods that required multiple parameters, such as dayOfYear or numberOfLeapYears. I originally had a little trouble in getting these parameters as input in the endpoint, and after some research, I found that the syntax in the endpoint is something like this: /{var1}/{var2}/{etc}. Then, to specify multiple PathVariables, simply split them apart with commas, like this: &lt;code&gt;@PathVariable int var, @PathVariable int var2&lt;/code&gt;. . Using the debugger . The debugger not only helped me in debugging code; it also helped me to learn how the code works. One thing that I was confused about was what the toString() method did in Year.java. By running the debugger on the tester, (as seen below), . I learned that there is a default toString() method. This is overriden in the Year class. The System.out.println automatically calls the toString() method, which is why an output in JSON format is shown when the tester is run. . . Using Postman . .",

Turn on | Turn on | Turn on | Turn on | Turn on | Turn on | Turn on | Turn on | . | | | | | | | | . Learnings from code: . When I first looked at the code for the binary table, I was confused with some of the syntax. Below is a documentation of things that I learned and an explanation of the code. . Many buttons have an id. This id is later used in Javascript. Furthermore, this: {{ i }} is liquid syntax. The i is referred from the for loop, whose syntax is this: {% for i in (start-num .. end-num). . Looking at the first button, there is a function called add. This results in calling the add function in JavaScript. Within the function, the getBits function is called and stored within the variable binary. This function takes the current values of the binary (the 0s or 1s underneath the light bulbs) and stores it into a variable called bits. Next, the variable decimal takes binary and converts it from base 2 into decimal. . The next part is confusing. Within the if statement, n &gt; 0 means that the +1 button was pressed, while the else statement means that the -1 button was pressed. The decimal of the binary value is then set to a certain number. In decimal = MAX === decimal ? 0 : decimal += n, MAX === decimal is a boolean expression which says that if true, the first option before : will run, and if false, the second option will run. MAX, as defined in the constructor, is equal to 255. Therefore, the code is saying that if the decimal (remember that the decimal is equivalent to the value of the 0s and 1s underneath the light bulbs) number is equal to 255, then when you add 1, turn the decimal number into 0 (since the maximum is 8 bits, 2^8 = 256, binary starts from 0, so maximum number is 255). However, if the decimal number is not equal to MAX, just add 1 to decimal. Same thing in the else part of the loop, only this time, it refers to if the -1 button is clicked. If decimal is 0, when the -1 button is clicked, go back to 255, otherwise, just decrease by 1. . After that, the decimal number is converted to binary and stored in the binary variable. To convert to binary, the decimal_2_base function is ran. Within the function, something new that I saw was the do while loop. I learned that the difference between this loop and the while loop was that the while loop would run only if the condition is fulfilled. The do while loop will always run once, and then if the condition in the while portion is fulfilled, the loop will run again. Within the loop, the variable digit is assigned to be equal to the remainder of the decimal number and the base, which when passed into the decimal_2_base function, was 2. digit is then passed into the variable conversion as a string. The next piece of code that I was confused about was ~~(decimal / base);. This is the same as Math.floor(), but runs faster. This piece of code devices the two variables decimal and base, and rounds to the largest integer that is less than or equal to the value. . For example, if decimal = 5, and base = 2, ~~(decimal / base) = ~~(2.5) which will round down to 2. .",

Why I chose the wrong answer: I was not familiar with the .add method. I was actually on the right track; however, when I went through the for loop the first time, I assumed that baboon would always be at index of 1, leading me to choose D instead of B. . | What I learned: Make sure to iterate through the entire for loop until the condition is false. . | . . . Why I chose the wrong answer: I did not understand that both the reference parameter and the actual parameter are aliases. . | What I learned: Passing a reference parameter results in it and the actual parameter being aliases to the same object. Therefore, changes made in the mystery method will also appear in values. Replacing the element of one index after the current index with the sum of the element in the current and subsequent index will result in the answer choice of C. . | . . . Why I chose the wrong answer: I forgot to check the second part of the OR conditional, where k&lt;4. . | What I learned: Since k is always less than 4, there would be an infinite loop. . | .",

            "content": "Notes . What I learned . Static methods are used mainly for convenience. If you create a regular method, you need to create an object to execute the method. However, an object does not need to be created to access a static method. . Polymorphism: This is used with Java extends. When a method in the subclass has the same name as the superclass, the subclass&#39;s method will override the superclass&#39;s. . Late binding results in overriding, or using the specific subclass&#39;s method during run time. On the other hand, if two methods have the same name but different parameters, using one method over the other would be called overloading. . private vs protected: Private only allows access within the class, while protected allows access in the same package or subclasses. . Below is a piece of code that illustrates many parts of a class. . public class Person { private int age; private int height; public Person(){ } public int getAge() { return this.age; } public void setAge(int age) { this.age = age; } public int getHeight() { return this.height; } public void setHeight(int height) { this.height = height; } public static void main(String[] args) { Person person1 = new Person(); person1.setAge(20); person1.setHeight(65); System.out.println(&quot;person1&#39;s age is: &quot; + person1.getAge()); System.out.println(&quot;person1&#39;s height is: &quot; + person1.getHeight()); } } Person.main(null) . person1&#39;s age is: 20 person1&#39;s height is: 65 . Explanation of items in the code . A class is like a blueprint for an object. In this case, the class is Person (names of classes by convention have the first letter capitalized). The Person class has an empty constructor. Common things found in a class are getters and setters. Getters are created with getvariable name, and setters are created with setvariable name. In both cases, the first letter of the variable name should be capitalized, as in accordance with Java variable naming conventions. Getters and setters are used to protect your data so that you do not assign unintended values to your variables. Lastly, the this keyword is used to refer to the declared variables. this is used to differentiate between the declared variables and the variables that are passed into a method as parameters and who may have the same name. . Access modifiers . public allows visibility outside of the declared class, while private only allows visibility within the class. . public class Access{ public int x = 5; } public class AccessTwo { public static void main(String[] args) { Access variableDemo = new Access(); System.out.println(variableDemo.x); } } AccessTwo.main(null) . 5 . Compare with this: . public class Access{ private int x = 5; // x is private } public class AccessTwo { public static void main(String[] args) { Access variableDemo = new Access(); System.out.println(variableDemo.x); } } AccessTwo.main(null) . | System.out.println(variableDemo.x); x has private access in Access . On the other hand, protected allows access only in the same package and subclasses. . public class Access{ protected int x = 5; // x is private } public class AccessTwo extends Access { public static void main(String[] args) { AccessTwo variableDemo = new AccessTwo(); System.out.println(variableDemo.x); } } AccessTwo.main(null) . 5 . Static vs nonstatic . In short, to access a variable from a static method, the variable must be declared with static. . static variables can be accessed in both static and nonstatic methods. nonstatic variables can only be accessed in nonstatic methods . public class staticDemo{ static int staticVar = 5; public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(staticVar); } } staticDemo.main(null) . 5 . This will produce an error because there is no static! . public class staticDemo{ int staticVar = 5; public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(staticVar); } } staticDemo.main(null) . | System.out.println(staticVar); non-static variable staticVar cannot be referenced from a static context . Static variables can be accessed in nonstatic methods! . public class staticDemo{ static int staticVar = 5; public void printVar() { System.out.println(staticVar); } public static void main(String[] args) { staticDemo a = new staticDemo(); a.printVar(); } } staticDemo.main(null) . 5 . Tester methods . Tester methods can be used to test if your code is working the way you want it to work. . Inheritance . public class Cat{ public boolean hasTail() { return true; } public void sayMeow() { System.out.println(&quot;Meow!&quot;); } } . public class TabbyCat extends Cat { public String furType() { return &quot;striped&quot;; } public boolean hasTail() { return super.hasTail(); } public static void main (String[] args) { TabbyCat cat1 = new TabbyCat(); cat1.sayMeow(); System.out.println(&quot;Tabby cat fur type: &quot; + cat1.furType()); System.out.println(&quot;Tabby cat has tail? &quot; + cat1.hasTail()); } } TabbyCat.main(null) . Meow! Tabby cat fur type: striped Tabby cat has tail? true . In the example above, the superclass is Cat, while the subclass is TabbyCat. Extends helps save time from copying and pasting code. TabbyCat has access to all of the methods in Cat, but also has its specific method, furType(). The super keyword calls the superclass. . One interesting thing is that if the subclass has the same method as the superclass, the subclass&#39;s method will override the superclass. This is called polymorphism. See below: . public class TabbyCat extends Cat { public String furType() { return &quot;striped&quot;; } public boolean hasTail() { return false; // oof } public static void main (String[] args) { TabbyCat cat1 = new TabbyCat(); System.out.println(&quot;Tabby cat has tail? &quot; + cat1.hasTail()); } } TabbyCat.main(null) . Tabby cat has tail? false . During compilation though, the hasTail() method will be looked for in the Cat class. Only during run time, the method will be resolved to the TabbyCat object. This is called late binding (using overriding) . Something very cool in Java is that you can have methods with the same name, as long as they have different parameters. This would result in overloading. . Abstract classes . Objects can not be created from abstract classes. Abstract classes serve as a blueprint that other classes can extend from. . abstract class AbstractCat { public void sayMeow() { System.out.println(&quot;meow&quot;); } } . class TabbyCatAbstract extends AbstractCat{ public String furType() { return &quot;striped&quot;; } public static void main(String[] args) { TabbyCatAbstract tabbycat = new TabbyCatAbstract(); System.out.println(tabbycat.furType()); } } TabbyCatAbstract.main(null) . striped . toString() . toString changes the value into a String object . Integer x = 5; System.out.println(&quot;Data type of x is: &quot; + x.toString().getClass().getSimpleName()); . Data type of x is: String . hashCode() . hashCode returns the hash code for an object. If obj1.equals(obj2), then obj1.hashCode() == obj2.hashCode(); . String text = new String(&quot;foo&quot;); String text2 = new String(&quot;foo&quot;); if (text.equals(text2)) { System.out.println(text.hashCode() == text2.hashCode()); } . true . Big O notation . Big O provides the worst case time complexity of an algorithm. It is written in the format of O(n), where n is the size of the input. The worst case time complexity is taken in that say if the function was 2n+3, you would write it as O(n) because as n increases, the 3 becomes less important. . The Big O notation for hash maps is O(1), which is the fastest possible running time. Binary search is O(logn). A single loop is O(n), while a nested loop is O(n^2). . 2019 FRQ #2 . Initial attempt . public class StepTracker { private int numDay; private int activeSteps; private int totalSteps; private int numActiveDays; public StepTracker(int steps) { activeSteps = steps; } public int activeDays() { return numActiveDays; } public double averageSteps() { return totalSteps/numDay; } public void addDailySteps(int steps) { totalSteps += steps; numDay++; if (steps &gt;= activeSteps) { numActiveDays++; } } } . Comments: . In the method averageSteps(), I did not do a type conversion to double in my return statement. A type conversion is needed because totalSteps and numDay are integers. . I also did not account for when numDay = 0, because the return statement can not be divided by 0. Therefore, an if statement is needed to return an average step of 0. . Corrections: . public class StepTracker { private int numDay; private int activeSteps; private int totalSteps; private int numActiveDays; public StepTracker(int steps) { activeSteps = steps; } public int activeDays() { return numActiveDays; } public double averageSteps() { if (numDay == 0) { // corrections return 0.0; } else { return (double) totalSteps/numDay; } } public void addDailySteps(int steps) { totalSteps += steps; numDay++; if (steps &gt;= activeSteps) { numActiveDays++; } } } .",

            "content": "Unit 1 Primitives . Note: Credit to Period 1&#39;s Primitives presentation for the information below . What are primitives? . Primitives include certain data types, such as integer, doubles, booleans, char, float, and long. Primitive names typically start with a lowercase letter, and if needed, subsequent words start with an uppercase letter. . To switch between primitive data types, casting can be used. . There are 5 types of operators: +=, -=, *=, /=, and %= and an increment and decrement operator: ++ and --. . Scanners . To take in input in java, the Scanner class needs to be first imported with import java.util.Scanner;. Next, a scanner object can be created with Scanner object name = new Scanner(System.in). To take in input, specify the data type that the scanner takes in with scanner.nextdata type . Unit 2 Objects . What are objects? . Objects are instances of a class. There are three steps to create an object: declaration, instantiation, and initialization. Declaration is specified through a type followed by the variable name. Instantiation instantiates the object with the new keyword. Initialization occurs the name of the constructor method is specified after the new keyword. . Creating objects . The syntax to create objects is: Class-name object-name = new constructor-name . Methods . Methods are defined with a return type (int, bool, etc. or void (no return type)) and the method name. . Static vs non static . A static method can only access other static methods, while a nonstatic method can access both static and nonstatic methods. . Math class . Important methods: Math.abs, Math.random() . Unit 4 Iteration . while loops . The syntax of a while loop looks like this: . while (condition) { } . Everytime the while loop executes, it first checks the condition. If the condition is true, the code inside the loop is ran. After the code finishes, the while loop checks again with the condition. . for loops . The syntax of a for loop looks like this: . for (initialize variable; condition; change variable) { } . Every time the for loop executes, it checks the condition. If the condition is true, the code inside the for loop is ran. After the code finishes running, the variable is incremented by the amount specified. . . There can also be nested iteration (ex: for loop within for loop) . for each loop . The syntax for a for-each loop looks like this: . for (dataType item : array){ } . This is especially useful for iterating through arrays. . Unit 5 Writing Classes . What are classes? . Classes are the blueprints for objects. They contain instance variables, constructors, and methods. Objects are instances of classes. . Access modifiers . public: Can be accessed in classes outside of the declaring class . private: Can only be accessed in the declaring class . Getters and setters . Getters help make variables read only. Setters allow write only permissions. . The syntax for getters is: . public data-type getName . Unit 6 Arrays . What are arrays? . Arrays can only be used to store one data type. They are different from ArrayLists in that they are not as flexible; the size of an array is fixed. . To create an array, you can either use constructors (dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[numerOfItems]), or you can use pre-initiliazed arrays (dataType[] arrayName = {elements}) . Traversing arrays . Arrays can be traversed using a for or while loop. . ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: This occurs when the loop tries to access a nonexistant index in the array. . for each loop . The syntax is: . for (dataType i : arrayName) { // code } . This is usually used to iterate through each item in the for each loop. .",

            "title": "Unit 2 Using Objects",
            "content": "Learnings . This unit had some very important learnings for me. The first thing that I learned was that if two strings are created in the format of String string1 = new String(&quot;string&quot;), the .equals() method should be used to compare them. . The second thing that I learned was that there is a way to compare if the attributes of two objects are the same using the .equals() method. However, this requires some manual overriding of the .equals() method because by default, .equals() works the same as ==, which compares the object memory address. You can still compare if two objects are the same object with ==. . Notes . Objects are instances of a class. There are three steps to create an object: declaration, instantiation, and initialization. Declaration is specified through a type followed by the variable name. Instantiation instantiates the object with the new keyword. Initialization occurs the name of the constructor method is specified after the new keyword. . Creating objects . The syntax to create objects is: Class-name object-name = new constructor-name . Methods . Methods are defined with a return type (int, bool, etc. or void (no return type)) and the method name. . Static vs non static . A static method can only access other static methods, while a nonstatic method can access both static and nonstatic methods. . Math class . Important methods: Math.abs, Math.random() . Comparing . Numbers . Numbers can be compared using ==. Numbers can always be compared with == because they are primitive types and not objects. . int a = 5; int b = 5; if (a == b) { System.out.println(&quot;a = b&quot;); } . a = b . Strings . There are two ways to compare strings: == and .equals(). . You can use == to compare strings when they are declared like this: String name = &quot;string&quot;; . An example is shown below: . String a = &quot;foo&quot;; String b = &quot;foo&quot;; if (a == b) { System.out.println(&quot;The two strings are equal&quot;); } . The two strings are equal . However, if your two strings are objects, you can not use == to compare them (see below): . String a = new String(&quot;foo&quot;); String b = new String(&quot;foo&quot;); if (a == b) { System.out.println(&quot;The two strings are equal&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;The two strings are not equal&quot;); } . The two strings are not equal . Instead, you need to use .equals() to compare the two string objects. . String a = new String(&quot;foo&quot;); String b = new String(&quot;foo&quot;); if (a.equals(b)) { System.out.println(&quot;The two strings are equal&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;The two strings are not equal&quot;); } . The two strings are equal . Note: a and b are different objects, but they contain the same string of foo, which is what .equals() checks for. . Objects . There is a way to compare if two objects have the same attributes using the .equals() method. However, you need to first override the method to do so. . Below is an example: . To override the .equals() method, you need to create the method that takes in an object. In this example, the object is the format of Object obj. In the .equals() method, Object obj refers to test2. Next, obj needs to be typecasted to the class, in this case ObjectTest, for comparison to work. The return statement checks to see if the attributes of the two objects are equal. Note: this refers to test1 . public class ObjectTest { String attribute1; String attribute2; // IMPORTANT: forgot to specify String in parameters // see https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/threads/346224/identifier-expected-in-constructor-definition // youtube reference for comparing objects: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2AjBFZfFCY public ObjectTest(String attribute1, String attribute2) { this.attribute1 = attribute1; this.attribute2 = attribute2; } @Override public boolean equals(Object obj) { ObjectTest test = (ObjectTest)obj; return this.attribute1.equals(test.attribute1) &amp;&amp; this.attribute2.equals(test.attribute2); } public static void main(String[] args) { ObjectTest test1 = new ObjectTest(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;); ObjectTest test2 = new ObjectTest(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;); if (test1.equals(test2)) { System.out.println(&quot;Same attributes&quot;); } } } ObjectTest.main(null) . Same attributes . 1a . Initial attempt: . Comments: I started off alright; however, I was soon stuck at the for loop part. I knew that I had to use a for loop to perform iteration that will compare the substring to secret, but I did not know how to compare to certain characters within a string. After looking at part of the answers, I found that the program utilized the substring() method, which I did not know what it did. After some googling, I applied my knowledge to the code below in my second attempt. . public int scoreGuess(String guess) { int substring; int length = guess.length(); int score; for () score = substring * length * length; } . Second attempt . Comments: This attempt mostly matched the answer key. One thing that I did wrong, however, was that in my comparison in the if statement, I used == instead of .equals. I have seen .equals() before, but I have never used it, so once again, I had to do some googling. I learned that if you want to compare two objects, you would need to use the .equals() method. In this case, secret is an object, as indicated by this line of code: private String secret; . public int scoreGuess(String guess) { int length = guess.length(); int count; int score; for (int i = 0; i &lt; (secret.length() - (length - 1)); i++) { if (guess == secret.substring(i, length)) { count++; length++; } } score = count * length * length; return score; } . Correction: . public int scoreGuess(String guess) { int length = guess.length(); int count; int score; for (int i = 0; i &lt; (secret.length() - (length - 1)); i++) { if (guess.equals(secret.substring(i, length))) { count++; length++; } } score = count * length * length; return score; } . . 1b . Initial attempt: . Comments: I made this a lot more complicated than it needed to be 😳 . Mistakes: I forgot that objects do not need to be created within the findBetterGuess method since findBetterGuess and scoreGuess are in the same class. . Looking at the answer, I learned about the method called compareTo(), which allowed for comparison between strings. compareTo() returns an integer, in which if the integer is smaller than 0, the first string is alphabetically smaller than the second string.

The main problem with a regular array is that elements can not be added or removed from the array (can not change the array size). This is made possible with ArrayList . To begin, start by creating an ArrayList object: . import java.util.ArrayList; abstract class ArrayListDemo{ ArrayList&lt;String&gt; alphabet = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)); public ArrayListDemo() { } protected abstract void changes(); } . Add, edit, and remove elements . To add elements, use the add() method. To add an element at a specific index, use add(index, element). To add all elements in an array to another array, use addAll(index, array). To edit elements, use set(index, element). To remove elements at a specific index, use the remove(index) method, or to remove a specific element, use remove(element). To clear an array, use the clear() method. . Add elements . public class SpecificArray extends ArrayListDemo { public SpecificArray() { } public void changes() { super.alphabet.add(&quot;d&quot;); super.alphabet.add(1, &quot;z&quot;); System.out.println(super.alphabet); } public static void main(String[] args) { SpecificArray changeArray = new SpecificArray(); changeArray.changes(); } } SpecificArray.main(null); .

To see the specific element at an index, use the get() method. indexOf(element) will return the first index that the element is in, while lastIndexOf(element) will return the index of the last occurrence of the element. To find the associated hash of the array, use the hashCode() method. The isEmpty() method will return true if the array is empty, and false if not. To check if the array contains an element, use the contains(element) method. To check if two arrays are equal to each other, use the equals(array) method, and to check if an array contains all of the elements in a collection, use the containsAll(array) method.

            "content": "Crime News API . . Map API . . How I created a table in Java backend using an API . This took me a whole day to figure out. . Learning about APIs is still an ongoing process for me, so below, I’ll document the things that I learned about APIs and what I picked up while coding. . The code that I started with was what I took from the RapidAPI website. I then used some code to parse the JSON response. This was the place that messed me up for a long time, as I kept receiving errors in my code. After hours of googling, I finally found the answer, and that fixed things up. . However, the most important things I learned was: . The API calling process in Java | Thymeleaf | API calling process in Java . First, an HTTP client needs to be created with HttpClient. Next, a request using HttpRequest is created to send a request to the HTTP client. Within the request, the type of request (GET), URI, and headers are specified. Putting it all together is build(). Then use the client to send back the HTTP request. . Thymeleaf . After receiving the JSON data, an issue that I ran into was to output the data into a table format on the frontend of Spring boot. I took a look at some of the programs already present in the spring portfolio, such as greet.html, knowing that it would have to convert backend data to frontend. Within the program, I noticed an interesting snippet of code which was ${name}. Googling the syntax lead me to learn about Thymeleaf, which is a Java template engine. This was really cool, because Thymeleaf changes Java data into HTML (which can actually be shown on a webpage). I’ll probably bore you with the details later when I update this blog further, but for now, you are spared :) Anyways, a simple Youtube search of “what is Thymeleaf” gave me an introduction of how to use this template language. The thing that was super useful that I learned from the video was that Thymeleaf uses th:each to iterate over arrays and lists. This allowed me to print the JSON data, which consisted of objects, into a table format. . . Misc . Benefits of using API include that it helps simplify the process between how the user interacts with the application and what data the application an receive from the server. . The benefits of backend implementation is that it allows for more control. For instance, the API access can be limited .",

            "title": "Fetch API Notes",
            "content": "Below is a documentation of me learning about APIs. . What is an API? . An API allows a developer to obtain data from web services. It performs abstraction to make tasks simpler for the user. Usually, an API acts between the application (what the user interacts with) and the server (contains the data, or resource). The process begins with the user creating an API call, which then proceeds with the application using the API to communicate with the server. The API then brings back the requested data to the user. . Types of APIs . REST API . The most common type of API is REST API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST APIs are typically associated with JSON, although the payload (data that the API delivers), can be in the form of HTML or XML. REST is used because of its speed and reliability. It also allows services to be used through HTTP. . Parts of a REST API include: . Endpoint: Includes URI: The url | HTTP method: What the client wants to do with a resource Includes GET (get), POST (make), PUT (update), DELETE (remove) | Headers: Contains things required for authentication and information about the client and server | Body: Other info included in the request | . When the client wants to access a resource, it sends a HTTP Request to the server. The server responds with a HTTP Response that contains data, or the representation about the resource, not the actual resource itself. The format of the representation cna be in XML or JSON. . What is Fetch API? . Fetch enables the user to make HTTP requests to servers. The Fetch API includes the fetch() method, which can take in two parameters, the URL and options. . fetch() returns a promise that can be used with the .then() and .catch() methods as well as being able to use async/await. . Once the request finishes, promise will resolve into a Response object. . Response is an API wrapper for what was fetched. . Now, what is an API wrapper? . To understand this, a helpful website first explained what a wrapper is. Basically, a wrapper helps make an item simpler by “wrapping” over the item. For instance, it can use abstraction to help simplify code. It can also convert data to make it more compatible. . Thus, an API wrapper allows you to combine many API calls into one to make things simpler. . . Alright, where was I? Right, Response. . Feel like showing the response? Below is an example of reading the response if it is in raw text. (Don’t really understand it at the moment, will research more about it later) . fetch(&#39;/readme.txt&#39;) .then(response =&gt; response.text()) .then(data =&gt; console.log(data)); . Question: Is /readme.txt the URL? It looks like a file… Can a file be a URL? . I’m guessing /readme.txt is the URL to the README file. . Below is an explanation of a typical piece of code that you many find in a Fetch API: . .then(response =&gt; response.json()) .then(data =&gt; console.log(data)) . Question to self: What is the difference between .then(data =&gt; console.log(data)) and .then(response =&gt; console.log(response))? . response: The response object that is returned by fetch. . response.json(): The response object does not return directly accessible data. Instead, the response needs to parsed into JSON using the json() method. . data: The JSON data . . You can also see the status code using the Response object. This can be accessed with the status property (response.status). . Quick lesson on status codes: . 200 is the status code you want, it means that the request was successful. | 404 means that what was requested does not exist | 500 means that there is a server error | . Note: fetch always succeeds, which means that even if the server responds with a 404, an error message would not show even if a catch statement was implemented. . Misc . Quick definition about entity: In programming, an entity is an object, which means it can include attributes and methods. . Allows access to the API through a specific programming language. . . Below is an example that uses the Fetch API to display airplane flight codes in a table: . IATA Code Name ICAO Code .",

Original: 499298 389x413 images/MonaLisa.png Scaled: 55625 128x136 images/tmp/MonaLisa.png . . Explanation of code . First, the monaLisa object is created, which calls the Pics constructor and passes in a name of MonaLisa and an ext (extension) of .png. These are assigned to the attributes, creating an input file (images/MonaLisa.png), an output (resized) file (images/MonaLisa.png), and an output (ASCII) file (images/tmp/MonaLisa.txt). . Next, the setStats() method is called. The path of the input file is assigned to the path object. The number of bytes is also assigned, and then ImageIO reads the input file and obtains its width and height, assigning them to their respective variables. . Now going back to the main method, the monaLisa object calls the printStats() method and passes in the argument of &quot;Original&quot;. This basically outputs some information of the input file, such as its size, width, and height. As you can see in the output above, the printStats() method outputs, Original: 499298 389x413 images/MonaLisa.png. . Afterwards, the monaLisa object calls the resize() method with an argument of 33 (resize the image to 33%). An Image object is created. Note: this is really important, the Image object needs to be created out of the try catch block, because if it is created within, the scope of the Image object is within the try catch block and can not be accessed outside. See this for more info. Moving on, the width and height are defined based on the resized scale, and the input file is once again read into img. The resizedImg is obtained by using the getScaledInstance method and assigning it the resized width and height. Next, resizedImg is converted into a buffered image with the name of the resizedFile (images/tmp/MonaLisa.png). The resizedFile is then set as the path of the input file. Once again, the setStats() method is called. . Because of scope of variables, some values of the variables have changed. The path of the input file (inFile) is now assigned to path. The size of the resized file is recorded, and the file is also read in by ImageIO. Additionally, the width and height of the resized file is recorded. . Going back to the main method, the printStats() method is called. Same thing as before, this outputs Scaled: 55625 128x136 images/tmp/MonaLisa.png. . Lastly, the convertToAscii() method is called. Once again, the Image object needs to be set as null outside of the try catch block in order to fulfill the scope of the variable. The first try catch block ensures that if there is already an Ascii file in the output directory, the file would be removed. Next, the PrintWriter and FileWriter object is called to output text (ASCII characters) into the ASCII file (images/tmp/MonaLisa.txt). ImageIO then reads the input file. . Onto the for loop, each pixel of the image is iterated, and a value is calculated based on the RGB value of the pixel. The larger the value (closer to white, or 255), the less space the ASCII character will pick up. As for smaller values (closer to black, or 0), the ASCII character will take up more space. This is called by the asciiChar(double g) method, and it returns the ASCII character. .

Skills . Skill 1.B: Determine code that would be used to complete code segments: (Explained in each type of code above) . | Skill 4.C: Determine if two or more code segments yield equivalent results . It&#39;s pretty simple to see how the for loop and while loop achieve the same results. In the for loop, each line of code is implemented, and after the program reaches the end of the loop, the loop is repeated (with i incrementing by 1), until i = 20 (the value of size). . The recursion is a little bit more complicated. First, the recursive loop is called within the init method, and then proceeds to run through the code. At the end of the code, i is incremented by 1, and the last line of code, recursiveLoop(i) tells the program to run the recursive loop again, repeating until i = 20. . tldr; As a result, all three methods achieve the same result in that the code within the loop is ran, i increases by 1, which causes the loop to run again until i = 20. . | Skill 5.A: Describe the behavior of a given segment of program code: (Explained in each type of code above) . Timing: Using system.nanoTime(), it seems as if the for loop runs the fastest, followed by recursion, and lastly the while loop. . | . Things I learned . From the example of Fibo using stream. . this(): Calls constructor with the same name in the current class . Stream.iterate(new long[]{0, 1}, f -&gt; new long[]{f[1], f[0] + f[1]}): . new long[]{0, 1}: Creates an array, becomes the seed for the Stream.iterate method | f -&gt; new long[]{f[1], f[0] + f[1]}: Lambda expression, passing in the parameter of f into the function new long[]{f[1], f[0] + f[1]} | . .limit(this.size): Set a limit (in this case, 20), to the number of times the stream iterates . .forEach(f -&gt; this.setData(f[0]));: For each item, run the setData() method . Hashmap: Unlike an array that is accessed through an index, a hashmap uses key/value pairs. As a result, the index of a hashmap can be an string, whereas the index of an array is an integer. . . An explanation of the Fibo code using streams. . Looking at the code was pretty challenging, but after searching up each unfamiliar piece of code, I had a general idea of what the program does. . I will explain below what the code does so that it can further my understanding of Java. . By creating the fib object, the Fibo() constructor is ran. this(20); points to the Fibo(int nth) constructor. The code within the constructor is ran, mainly use to assign variables to various values. Next, the init() method is ran. An array is created within the stream. The stream will iterate 20 times, as determined with .limit(this.size). Next, for each item (the element in the array), the setData method will run with f[0] as an argument. When the stream iterates again, the array will change it&#39;s first element to the second element, and its second element to the sum of the first and second element. Now onto running the setData(long num) method. First, the element of f[0] will be added to the already created list. Next, a hashmap will be created, with a key with the index number, and a value with a duplicate of the list (list.clone();). Going back to the main method, fib.print(); runs the print() method. I&#39;ll skip the basic calling the variable stuff and proceed to the second System.out.println, in which the getNth() method is ran. Here, the last element of the list (and you have to access the last element with this.size - 1 because there are 20 elements in the array, so the 20th element is accessed using the 19th index since indexes start at 0) is obtained to print the 20th Fibonacci number. Next, the entire Fibonacci array and hashmap is printed. Finally, the for loop outputs each of the values for the specified key. The Fibonacci sequence for each number is printed successfully because each key is associated with a list, which contains the Fibonacci sequence for the sequence number. .",

            "content": "Our Aim . We want to prioritize the customer before anything else; here’s how this will be done: . Our website will run smoothly with minimal errors | Try to keep our website as engaging as possible | Listen to reviews and make changes as necessary | Make the results accurate | About the Project . In this project, we are making a reverse dictionary. We were inspired by many students’ studious and driven culture and wanted to create a site that could help them. A problem that we noticed among many students, especially those in advanced English courses, is that they often don’t know or can’t remember the word they want to use. Through the use of this website, we want to help these students allowing them to do well where ever they choose to use this website. . How is This Done . In order to achieve this, we first need to get a basic understanding of how reverse dictionaries work and how to code them. After searching on Google, we came across many fascinating sites, some even explaining the basics of a reverse dictionary. Essentially it is looking for an output similar to the combination of the inputs. One of our ideas was to make the user input either the definition of the word or other words related to the word they need. For example, if you’re searching for the word “apple,” you can input “fruit,” “red,” and “grows on trees” to get your result. And currently, we are planning to code most of this with Python, use HTML to display everything, and use JavaScript to allow the user to interact with the results. . Create Performance Task Categories . 1 Program Purpose and Function . See above . 2 Abstraction . Each synonym could be stored in a list, which would either be manually created by us (less likely), or given in the API (more likely). The hard part would be to find a reverse dictionary API. . Managing Complexity . By using a list to store the synonyms of words, the code would be simplified so that multiple variables, each storing only one word, would not be needed. . 4 Procedural Abstraction . We could make functions that include that collect the user’s inputs of various word definitions. These inputs would then need to be processed by comparing with the information in the API and then being able to output the ideal words to frontend. . 5 Algorithm Implementation . Recursion can be used to repeatedly find definitions that contain certain keywords that the user implemented. if statements could be used to select the words with the closest definition and display them under a category, then select the words with a moderate level of closeness and put them in another category. . 6 Testing . Many parts of the program would include the need for testing. First of all, we need to implement an API and connect the frontend with the backend so that the frontend can display information about the API. This would require testing by inputting many definitions and seeing if the outcome word is what is desired. . Team Scrum Board . Team Scrum Board . Agile Methodology Diagram . . Our team used Slack as a form of communication to plan out our project. . .",

            "content": "2022 #1a . First attempt: . public int getScore() { Level goal = new Level(); Level points = new Level(); int pointTotal = 0; if (goal.goalReached()) { pointTotal = points.getPoints(); } } . I got stuck at the point above, so I looked at part of the answers. Here is my attempt afterwards: . What the code does: . A variable pointTotal is created that records the amount of points that the player earns. Since the points from level 2 and level 3 are earned only if the previous level is completed, I created if loops within the if loop. . After the points from the levels are totaled, the code then tests the ifBonus method. This is a boolean if statement where if ifBonus is true, the total score would triple. . public int getScore() { int pointTotal = 0; if (levelOne.goalReached()) { pointTotal += levelOne.getPoints(); if (levelTwo.goalReached()) { pointTotal += levelTwo.getPoints(); if (levelThree.goalReached()) { pointTotal += levelThree.getPoints(); } } } if (isBonus()) { pointTotal *= 3; } return pointTotal; } . Questions: . Why are objects not defined to call goalReached and getPoints? | . After some researching, I learned from this video that if methods are in the same class (isBonus and getScore are in the same class), an object does not need to be created to call the method. . #1b . public int playManyTimes(int num) { int scores[]; int maxScore = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) { play(); scores[i] = getScore(); } for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) { if (scores[i] &gt; maxScore) { maxScore = scores[i]; } } return maxScore; } . An array wasn&#39;t needed. All you had to do was compare the scores within the for loop like this: . public int playManyTimes(int num) { int maxScore = 0; int score = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) { play(); score = getScore(); if (score &gt; maxScore) { maxScore = score; } } return maxScore; } . . 2016 #1a . Initial thoughts: . When I first read the question, I did not know where to start, so I looked at part of the answers to guide me on what to learn. . Looking at this, . . I was confused as to what List&lt;String&gt; was, so I googled it. . I learned that List&lt;String&gt; is used to make an object that can store the array list. For instance, List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); . I also saw how an array list can also be created with ArrayList&lt;String&gt;. The difference between ArrayList&lt;String&gt; and List&lt;String&gt; is that with List&lt;String&gt;, you can typecast the array list into a different type of list; however, you can&#39;t do that with ArrayList&lt;String&gt;. . The code below is what I got started with before I became stuck again. . public class RandomStringChooser { private List&lt;String&gt; words; public RandomStringChooser(String[] wordArray) { words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); } } . Once again not knowing how to proceed, I took a look at the answers and came upon this: . . Because I had no idea what the syntax meant, I hopped onto Google and did some searching. . So, for (String singleWord : wordArray) is an example of a for-each loop. A for-each loop allows you to loop through the elements in an array list. . Below is a simple example of a for-each loop: . public class ForEachDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { List&lt;String&gt; fruits = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;pineapple&quot;, &quot;mango&quot;)); for (String i : fruits) { System.out.println(i); } } } ForEachDemo.main(null); . apple pineapple mango . This essentially creates is the same as using a regular for loop, and printing out each index in the array list using .get. .get returns the element specified in the index number. . public class GetDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { List&lt;String&gt; fruits = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;pineapple&quot;, &quot;mango&quot;)); // same as: // for (String i : fruits) { // System.out.println(i); // } for (int i = 0; i &lt; fruits.size(); i++) { System.out.println(fruits.get(i)); } } } GetDemo.main(null); . apple pineapple mango . The code below is my continued attempt at answering 1a, after learning about the for-each loop. . public class RandomStringChooser { private List&lt;String&gt; words; // creating an object words public RandomStringChooser(String[] wordArray) { words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); // assigning words to a new array list for (String singleWord : wordArray) { // add all of the elements in wordArray to words words.add(singleWord); } public String getNext() { return words.remove((int)(Math.random() * words.size())); } } } . This was close, but I forgot that NONE should be the output once all of the elements in the array list have been used. The correct answer is: . public class RandomStringChooser { private List&lt;String&gt; words; // creating an object words public RandomStringChooser(String[] wordArray) { words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); // assigning words to a new array list for (String singleWord : wordArray) { // add all of the elements in wordArray to words words.add(singleWord); } public String getNext() { // forgot to write an if statement if (words.size() &gt; 0) { return words.remove((int)(Math.random() * words.size())); } return &quot;NONE&quot;; } } } . Concluding thoughts . This question was hard mainly because I had no idea what an array list was prior to doing this question. Although I looked at the answer key a few times, I researched all of the code that I did not understand to help me learn what an array list was, how to create it, and how to use iteration with array lists. . . 1b . Explanation: . If I&#39;m understanding correctly, when the object letterChooser is created, the RandomLetterChooser constructor will run. Since we want to create an array of strings, we would use the super keyword to call the getSingleLetters method, which will split the word into an array of strings. Then, System.out.print(letterChooser.getNext()); is ran, which will call the superclass&#39;s constructor and then run the getNext method. This will randomly output the characters. . The code below matched the answer key. . However, one thing that I wondered as I was examining the answer was, why was there no super() in RandomLetterChooser, which would call the superclass (RandomStringChooser). The answer, after some googling, told me that even if you don&#39;t type super(), the superclass will still implicitly be called. . public RandomLetterChooser(String str) { super(getSingleLetters(str)); } .",

The code can be written in any programming language that satisfies the requirements. . | Requirements include having: input, list that manages complexity, procedure with algorithm, a call to the procedure, and output . | A video demonstrating the code will also be required. Within the video, you will need to show at least one input and output and the program&#39;s function. . | . Speaking of functions, there is a difference between the word &quot;function&quot; and &quot;purpose&quot;: . Purpose: The problem that is being solved/something that you pursue for a creative interest . | Function: How the program acts when you run it . | . While we&#39;re at it, some other vocab that I was unfamiliar with 1: . Procedure: Same thing as function . | Algorithm: Code that performs a specific action . | . . Anyways, back to the notes: . In addition to the code and a video, you will also need to submit a written response. A written response consists of four parts, questions 3a-3d. . | 3a. You will be writing about the program&#39;s purpose. Why did you create this program? You will also be documenting the program&#39;s function. Remember: Function and purpose are two different things! . | 3b. How does your list manage complexity? . | 3c. What does your procedure do, and make sure to talk about your algorithm. . | 3d. Testing! Make two different test scenarios for your code. . | . . Plagiarism . Obviously, plagiarism is a serious thing, so don&#39;t do it. However, there are some tiny things that you may have to pay attention to while creating your program to ensure that you don&#39;t get caught for plagiarizing. . Anything that is not your own code - this includes libraries - must be cited . | If you are using pictures or music that is not yours, cite that too . | . . Citing doesn&#39;t have to be anything fancy, just note that you used someone else&#39;s work somewhere in your code. . Ideas . I&#39;m still thinking of some ideas for my create task. The one that I&#39;m most inclined to creating is a schedule/planner. . A record of how this project would fulfill the create task requirements: . Input: User input would be typing into a text box of their tasks for the day. User will also specify a certain amount of hours that they have to work that day. . | List: The user input of assignments will be stored into a list that contains all of the tasks. . | Procedure and algorithm: Most likely to calculate the amount of time each task should be spent on . | Output: Output will be a calculation of how long each task should be spent on for the day. Output may also give certain times to do the task. . | . . A few other notes: . The program will most likely start by equally dividing the total time amongst all activities. By entering more input, the user is able to change how many hours they want to spend on a task based on the task&#39;s priority. | . Plans for AP MCQ . Each week, I&#39;ll blog about what I learned that&#39;s related to the APCSP test prep. . | I can add vocab on the vocab page (on my blog).

            "content": "Here is the link to my app. . Subject . Since I’m in AP Stats, I decided to create a statistics quiz. . Questions . What is the mean of the following set of numbers: 5, 8, 9, 15, 16? | Normal distribution picture: What percent of data lies between one standard deviation of the mean? | A class of 30 students were surveyed on how many hours they sleep. The average was 7 hours with a standard deviation of 1.5 hours. What percentage of students sleep less than 8 hours? | Initial planning with partner . Shreyas and I planned out a general format for how we would make our individual apps. . We planned out four stages to make the app: design, brainstorm, implementation, and finishing. . We both created quizzes with three questions. Some of the code that we planned on excessive use was the onEvent function, which allowed an action to happen, such as switching the screen, given that something has occured, such as the click of a button. . Design . My app consists of six screens: Homepage, questions 1-3, end screen, and a finish screen. . Below are some pictures of what the initial design looked like: . . . After the initial design, I made a few revisions, namely changing the font, adding buttons (originally, the user had to click the screen), and adding radio buttons for the multiple choice selection. . An intermediate photo where I added a button: . . One of my screens on the final design: . . Coding . My code is relatively simple. A majority of the code used the onEvent function. I used the function for two purposes, the first was to change the screen when the Next button was pressed, and the second was to increase the score if the correct multiple choice was selected. . . Something else I made additionally was the use of a list that recorded if the user answered each individual question correctly. At the end of the quiz, the person would be able to receive feedback on what they answered correctly and anything that they could improve on, if needed. . I accomplished this by creating a list with the name of questionRight. The index of the array corresponded to the question, so if the user answered correctly on the first question, questionRight[0] would have a value of 1. At the end of the quiz, the questions that had a value of 1 would have a congratulations message, and the questions that had a value of 0 (incorrect) would have an explanation on how to arrive at the correct answer. . Explanations of code . This is a screenshot of part of my code. The rest of my code followed basically the same format. If you wish to check out my code, you can do so here. . . Here’s how the code works: . The first block of code is an onEvent function, in which when the next button (q1ButtonNext) was pressed, the app screen will change to the next question (q2Screen). . The second block of code is another onEvent function. This time though, when choice B is selected (q1ButtonB), a predefined variable score will increase by 1. . . Now I’ll give an overview on the use of a list in my app. First, I created a list called questionRight that contains three elements, each with the value 0. . . Later on in the code, if the user selects the correct answer choice for the button, the value of the element would become 1. . . At the end of the code, I used an if-else statement to decide which feedback message to show. If the element of the index is 0, the feedback for the wrong answer would be show; otherwise, the feedback, for the correct message would show. . . I could use individual variables in the code, but I used a list partially in preparation for the AP CSP Create Task. I think using a list would help in that if the quiz had more questions, using a list would be more organized than creating an individual variable for each question. . Things I learned . The code I encountered in AppLab was new to me. I used the documentation 1 very frequently. . I had to learn most of the things I coded. The most important code that I learned was the onEvent function. You can use it to specify an action to do when a certain event occurs, such as the press of a button. .

Then, I changed the background color to a gradient using the linear-gradient command within the html, body, input, textarea, select, button block. . That’s pretty much all I changed.

Alright, I’m going to be honest. This took me hours to figure out, mainly because I had errors in my Liquid syntax because I forgot to include a space ╥﹏╥. . This is the page where I created my table and linked my weekly assignments. . I started off with a for loop using the {% for i in ([start num]..[end num]) %} template, where i is the week number. I then created each row in the table starting with the week number by printing {{i}}. I also used if statements ({% if i == # %}) and printed the links to my pages depending on the value of i. So if i == 0, I would print the links to Week 0, etc. .",

And I thought, hey, this is interesting, what does {{site.baseurl}} do? . After some googling, I found that {{site.baseurl}} wasn’t something in Markdown. Turns out it’s actually Jekyll syntax. . So what does {{site.baseurl}} do? . Basically, baseurl is the directory under the URL of the website. 1 So for example, this blog’s URL is lwu1822.github.io, and the baseurl is fastpages. . So I can just do ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/diagram.png). Saves a lot of typing. . Pretty cool, huh? 😊 . . Something else I encountered while making this post . To type {{site.baseurl}} in this Markdown file, apparently you have to use the {% raw %} and {% endraw %} template around {{site.baseurl}} . 2 . Like this: . {% raw %} {{site.baseurl}} {% endraw %} . . Also something I encountered just as I was writing the line above . Notice how I was able to write {% endraw %} above? Unfortunately, it’s not that simple to just type it directly into your IDE, like this: . :warning: Warning: Don’t do this, it will break your code: . {% raw %} {% endraw %} {% endraw %} . The reason is because the first {% endraw %} will be interpreted as ending the {% raw %} template. . So if you want to be able to type {% endraw %} in Markdown, you need to do the following 3: . Create a variable, in this example, I’ll name it openTag, and assign it to {%: . {% assign openTag = &#39;{%&#39; %} . | Use the {{ openTag }} variable anytime you want to type text that contains {% in it. . For example, to type the text {% endraw %}, you would do: . {{ openTag }} endraw %} . | . Even more something that I learned . Apparently, you also can’t type {% directly in the IDE, which would also break your code (took me a long time to debug （ꐦ𝅒_𝅒）) . Instead, you have to type: {{ openTag }} . . Things for me to contemplate on: . I noticed on the provided Fastpages Notebook Blog Post, you can add an image without the baseurl. For example, you can specify an image with ![](images/diagram.png). Not sure why that works, but I’m guessing it has something to with Jupyter Notebooks. . . baseurl &#8617; . | Liquid template language &#8617; . | I took the steps from here but quite frankly, I found the explanation a little confusing, so I simplified it as much as I could in this blog &#8617; . |",

The skills learned in AP CSA and AP CSP are very applicable and can be used to solve real world problems. However, programmers face many difficulties in their coding career. For instance, Colin described about the constant error messages that are bound to show up while coding, which can leave a negative effect and greatly decrease motivation. One thing that really struck out to me, however, was the importance of google. Basically, any programming question you have can be solved by this very magical tool. Furthermore, PBLs not only occur in this class, but can also be found in colleges. For instance, Colin mentioned that in UCSD’s mechanical engineering, students will be tasked with a hands on project in their freshmen and senior year. The same methodologies still apply - scrum team and agile. Furthermore, not only is coding applied in CS majors, it is also used in other majors. For instance, Allison mentioned that stats majors are also required to program in R. A really cool example of where you could apply your coding knowledge was scripting. If you’re ever frustrated at repeating the same redundant tasks over and over again, hey- maybe try some automation :). Last but not least, a very important part of the event was the discussion of internships. Some tips that were brought up was to build a resume and to create some personal projects that demonstrate your passion for coding. Additionally, interaction with professors and TAs are a good idea to find research and programming opportunities. . . Notes that I took during the event . Challenge with compsci: .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
