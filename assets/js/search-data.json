            "content": "What is an ArrayList? . An ArrayList is like an array, except better :) . The main problem with a regular array is that elements can not be added or removed from the array (can not change the array size). This is made possible with ArrayList . To begin, start by creating an ArrayList object: . import java.util.ArrayList; abstract class ArrayListDemo{ ArrayList&lt;String&gt; alphabet = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)); public ArrayListDemo() { } protected abstract void changes(); } . Add, edit, and remove elements . To add elements, use the add() method. To add an element at a specific index, use add(index, element). To add all elements in an array to another array, use addAll(index, array). To edit elements, use set(index, element). To remove elements at a specific index, use the remove(index) method, or to remove a specific element, use remove(element). To clear an array, use the clear() method. . Add elements . public class SpecificArray extends ArrayListDemo { public SpecificArray() { } public void changes() { super.alphabet.add(&quot;d&quot;); super.alphabet.add(1, &quot;z&quot;); System.out.println(super.alphabet); } public static void main(String[] args) { SpecificArray changeArray = new SpecificArray(); changeArray.changes(); } } SpecificArray.main(null); . [a, z, b, c, d] . Edit elements . public class SpecificArray extends ArrayListDemo { public SpecificArray() { } public void changes() { super.alphabet.set(0, &quot;z&quot;); System.out.println(super.alphabet); } public static void main(String[] args) { SpecificArray changeArray = new SpecificArray(); changeArray.changes(); } } SpecificArray.main(null); .

[] . Array Info . To find the size of the array, use the size() method. To see the specific element at an index, use the get() method. indexOf(element) will return the first index that the element is in, while lastIndexOf(element) will return the index of the last occurrence of the element. To find the associated hash of the array, use the hashCode() method. The isEmpty() method will return true if the array is empty, and false if not. To check if the array contains an element, use the contains(element) method. To check if two arrays are equal to each other, use the equals(array) method, and to check if an array contains all of the elements in a collection, use the containsAll(array) method. To sort the elements in an ArrayList, use the sort() method. .

            "content": "Crime News API . . Map API . . How I created a table in Java backend using an API . This took me a whole day to figure out. . Learning about APIs is still an ongoing process for me, so below, I’ll document the things that I learned about APIs and what I picked up while coding. . The code that I started with was what I took from the RapidAPI website. I then used some code to parse the JSON response. This was the place that messed me up for a long time, as I kept receiving errors in my code. After hours of googling, I finally found the answer, and that fixed things up. . However, the most important things I learned was: . The API calling process in Java | Thymeleaf | API calling process in Java . First, an HTTP client needs to be created with HttpClient. Next, a request using HttpRequest is created to send a request to the HTTP client. Within the request, the type of request (GET), URI, and headers are specified. Putting it all together is build(). Then use the client to send back the HTTP request. . Thymeleaf . After receiving the JSON data, an issue that I ran into was to output the data into a table format on the frontend of Spring boot. I took a look at some of the programs already present in the spring portfolio, such as greet.html, knowing that it would have to convert backend data to frontend. Within the program, I noticed an interesting snippet of code which was ${name}. Googling the syntax lead me to learn about Thymeleaf, which is a Java template engine. This was really cool, because Thymeleaf changes Java data into HTML (which can actually be shown on a webpage). I’ll probably bore you with the details later when I update this blog further, but for now, you are spared :) Anyways, a simple Youtube search of “what is Thymeleaf” gave me an introduction of how to use this template language. The thing that was super useful that I learned from the video was that Thymeleaf uses th:each to iterate over arrays and lists. This allowed me to print the JSON data, which consisted of objects, into a table format. . . Misc . Benefits of using API include that it helps simplify the process between how the user interacts with the application and what data the application an receive from the server. . The benefits of backend implementation is that it allows for more control. For instance, the API access can be limited .",

            "title": "Fetch API",
            "content": "Below is a documentation of me learning about APIs. . What is an API? . An API allows a developer to obtain data from web services. It performs abstraction to make tasks simpler for the user. Usually, an API acts between the application (what the user interacts with) and the server (contains the data, or resource). The process begins with the user creating an API call, which then proceeds with the application using the API to communicate with the server. The API then brings back the requested data to the user. . Types of APIs . REST API . The most common type of API is REST API. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST APIs are typically associated with JSON, although the payload (data that the API delivers), can be in the form of HTML or XML. REST is used because of its speed and reliability. It also allows services to be used through HTTP. . Parts of a REST API include: . Endpoint: Includes URI: The url | HTTP method: What the client wants to do with a resource Includes GET (get), POST (make), PUT (update), DELETE (remove) | Headers: Contains things required for authentication and information about the client and server | Body: Other info included in the request | . When the client wants to access a resource, it sends a HTTP Request to the server. The server responds with a HTTP Response that contains data, or the representation about the resource, not the actual resource itself. The format of the representation cna be in XML or JSON. . What is Fetch API? . Fetch enables the user to make HTTP requests to servers. The Fetch API includes the fetch() method, which can take in two parameters, the URL and options. . fetch() returns a promise that can be used with the .then() and .catch() methods as well as being able to use async/await. . Once the request finishes, promise will resolve into a Response object. . Response is an API wrapper for what was fetched. . Now, what is an API wrapper? . To understand this, a helpful website first explained what a wrapper is. Basically, a wrapper helps make an item simpler by “wrapping” over the item. For instance, it can use abstraction to help simplify code. It can also convert data to make it more compatible. . Thus, an API wrapper allows you to combine many API calls into one to make things simpler. . . Alright, where was I? Right, Response. . Feel like showing the response? Below is an example of reading the response if it is in raw text. (Don’t really understand it at the moment, will research more about it later) . fetch(&#39;/readme.txt&#39;) .then(response =&gt; response.text()) .then(data =&gt; console.log(data)); . Question: Is /readme.txt the URL? It looks like a file… Can a file be a URL? . I’m guessing /readme.txt is the URL to the README file. . Below is an explanation of a typical piece of code that you many find in a Fetch API: . .then(response =&gt; response.json()) .then(data =&gt; console.log(data)) . Question to self: What is the difference between .then(data =&gt; console.log(data)) and .then(response =&gt; console.log(response))? . response: The response object that is returned by fetch. . response.json(): The response object does not return directly accessible data. Instead, the response needs to parsed into JSON using the json() method. . data: The JSON data . . You can also see the status code using the Response object. This can be accessed with the status property (response.status). . Quick lesson on status codes: . 200 is the status code you want, it means that the request was successful. | 404 means that what was requested does not exist | 500 means that there is a server error | . Note: fetch always succeeds, which means that even if the server responds with a 404, an error message would not show even if a catch statement was implemented. . Misc . Quick definition about entity: In programming, an entity is an object, which means it can include attributes and methods. . allows access to the API through a specific programming language. .

Original: 499298 389x413 images/MonaLisa.png Scaled: 55625 128x136 images/tmp/MonaLisa.png . . Explanation of code . First, the monaLisa object is created, which calls the Pics constructor and passes in a name of MonaLisa and an ext (extension) of .png. These are assigned to the attributes, creating an input file (images/MonaLisa.png), an output (resized) file (images/MonaLisa.png), and an output (ASCII) file (images/tmp/MonaLisa.txt). . Next, the setStats() method is called. The path of the input file is assigned to the path object. The number of bytes is also assigned, and then ImageIO reads the input file and obtains its width and height, assigning them to their respective variables. . Now going back to the main method, the monaLisa object calls the printStats() method and passes in the argument of &quot;Original&quot;. This basically outputs some information of the input file, such as its size, width, and height. As you can see in the output above, the printStats() method outputs, Original: 499298 389x413 images/MonaLisa.png. . Afterwards, the monaLisa object calls the resize() method with an argument of 33 (resize the image to 33%). An Image object is created. Note: this is really important, the Image object needs to be created out of the try catch block, because if it is created within, the scope of the Image object is within the try catch block and can not be accessed outside. See this for more info. Moving on, the width and height are defined based on the resized scale, and the input file is once again read into img. The resizedImg is obtained by using the getScaledInstance method and assigning it the resized width and height. Next, resizedImg is converted into a buffered image with the name of the resizedFile (images/tmp/MonaLisa.png). The resizedFile is then set as the path of the input file. Once again, the setStats() method is called. . Because of scope of variables, some values of the variables have changed. The path of the input file (inFile) is now assigned to path. The size of the resized file is recorded, and the file is also read in by ImageIO. Additionally, the width and height of the resized file is recorded. . Going back to the main method, the printStats() method is called. Same thing as before, this outputs Scaled: 55625 128x136 images/tmp/MonaLisa.png. . Lastly, the convertToAscii() method is called. Once again, the Image object needs to be set as null outside of the try catch block in order to fulfill the scope of the variable. The first try catch block ensures that if there is already an Ascii file in the output directory, the file would be removed. Next, the PrintWriter and FileWriter object is called to output text (ASCII characters) into the ASCII file (images/tmp/MonaLisa.txt). ImageIO then reads the input file. . Onto the for loop, each pixel of the image is iterated, and a value is calculated based on the RGB value of the pixel. The larger the value (closer to white, or 255), the less space the ASCII character will pick up. As for smaller values (closer to black, or 0), the ASCII character will take up more space. This is called by the asciiChar(double g) method, and it returns the ASCII character. .

Understanding the arrow function (=&gt;) took me awhile, but this is basically a shorthand way to write: . this.fruits.forEach(function(fruit) { this.combine.push(fruit); }); . which basically adds the elements in the fruit array into a new array called combine. .

Skills . Skill 1.B: Determine code that would be used to complete code segments: (Explained in each type of code above) . | Skill 4.C: Determine if two or more code segments yield equivalent results . It&#39;s pretty simple to see how the for loop and while loop achieve the same results. In the for loop, each line of code is implemented, and after the program reaches the end of the loop, the loop is repeated (with i incrementing by 1), until i = 20 (the value of size). . The recursion is a little bit more complicated. First, the recursive loop is called within the init method, and then proceeds to run through the code. At the end of the code, i is incremented by 1, and the last line of code, recursiveLoop(i) tells the program to run the recursive loop again, repeating until i = 20. . tldr; As a result, all three methods achieve the same result in that the code within the loop is ran, i increases by 1, which causes the loop to run again until i = 20. . | Skill 5.A: Describe the behavior of a given segment of program code: (Explained in each type of code above) . Timing: Using system.nanoTime(), it seems as if the for loop runs the fastest, followed by recursion, and lastly the while loop. . | . Things I learned . From the example of Fibo using stream. . this(): Calls constructor with the same name in the current class . Stream.iterate(new long[]{0, 1}, f -&gt; new long[]{f[1], f[0] + f[1]}): . new long[]{0, 1}: Creates an array, becomes the seed for the Stream.iterate method | f -&gt; new long[]{f[1], f[0] + f[1]}: Lambda expression, passing in the parameter of f into the function new long[]{f[1], f[0] + f[1]} | . .limit(this.size): Set a limit (in this case, 20), to the number of times the stream iterates . .forEach(f -&gt; this.setData(f[0]));: For each item, run the setData() method . Hashmap: Unlike an array that is accessed through an index, a hashmap uses key/value pairs. As a result, the index of a hashmap can be an string, whereas the index of an array is an integer. . . An explanation of the Fibo code using streams. . Looking at the code was pretty challenging, but after searching up each unfamiliar piece of code, I had a general idea of what the program does. . I will explain below what the code does so that it can further my understanding of Java. . By creating the fib object, the Fibo() constructor is ran. this(20); points to the Fibo(int nth) constructor. The code within the constructor is ran, mainly use to assign variables to various values. Next, the init() method is ran. An array is created within the stream. The stream will iterate 20 times, as determined with .limit(this.size). Next, for each item (the element in the array), the setData method will run with f[0] as an argument. When the stream iterates again, the array will change it&#39;s first element to the second element, and its second element to the sum of the first and second element. Now onto running the setData(long num) method. First, the element of f[0] will be added to the already created list. Next, a hashmap will be created, with a key with the index number, and a value with a duplicate of the list (list.clone();). Going back to the main method, fib.print(); runs the print() method. I&#39;ll skip the basic calling the variable stuff and proceed to the second System.out.println, in which the getNth() method is ran. Here, the last element of the list (and you have to access the last element with this.size - 1 because there are 20 elements in the array, so the 20th element is accessed using the 19th index since indexes start at 0) is obtained to print the 20th Fibonacci number. Next, the entire Fibonacci array and hashmap is printed. Finally, the for loop outputs each of the values for the specified key. The Fibonacci sequence for each number is printed successfully because each key is associated with a list, which contains the Fibonacci sequence for the sequence number. .",

Our website will run smoothly with minimal errors | Try to keep our website as engaging as possible | Listen to reviews and make changes as necessary | Make the results accurate | About the Project . In this project, we are making a reverse dictionary. We were inspired by many students’ studious and driven culture and wanted to create a site that could help them. A problem that we noticed among many students, especially those in advanced English courses, is that they often don’t know or can’t remember the word they want to use. Through the use of this website, we want to help these students allowing them to do well where ever they choose to use this website. . How is This Done . In order to achieve this, we first need to get a basic understanding of how reverse dictionaries work and how to code them. After searching on Google, we came across many fascinating sites, some even explaining the basics of a reverse dictionary. Essentially it is looking for an output similar to the combination of the inputs. One of our ideas was to make the user input either the definition of the word or other words related to the word they need. For example, if you’re searching for the word “apple,” you can input “fruit,” “red,” and “grows on trees” to get your result. And currently, we are planning to code most of this with Python, use HTML to display everything, and use JavaScript to allow the user to interact with the results. . Team Scrum Board .

CRD-1.A.5 Consultation and communication with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations. . CRD-1.A.6 Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives. . CRD-1.B.1 Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents. . CRD-1.B.2 Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration. . CRD-1.C.1 Effective collaborative teams practice interpersonal skills, including but not limited to: . communication | consensus building | conflict resolution | negotiation | . Collaboration allows people who specialize in different areas to work together to reach an end product. It can involve the combination of the diverse ideas of many people. Skills that are developed through collaboration include: communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation. . Computing innovation: A physical or nonphysical program. Examples include VSCode (nonphysical) or a self driving car (physical). . Collaboration can take place in many formats. Examples include: pair programming (one as driver, one as navigator), think-pair-share (students think through a problem alone, discuss in pairs, then share with class). . Online tools for collaboration: . repl.it | Github | Shared document/folder | . Comments in code also help with communication to yourself and others reading your code. . .

            "content": "2022 #1a . First attempt: . public int getScore() { Level goal = new Level(); Level points = new Level(); int pointTotal = 0; if (goal.goalReached()) { pointTotal = points.getPoints(); } } . I got stuck at the point above, so I looked at part of the answers. Here is my attempt afterwards: . What the code does: . A variable pointTotal is created that records the amount of points that the player earns. Since the points from level 2 and level 3 are earned only if the previous level is completed, I created if loops within the if loop. . After the points from the levels are totaled, the code then tests the ifBonus method. This is a boolean if statement where if ifBonus is true, the total score would triple. . public int getScore() { int pointTotal = 0; if (levelOne.goalReached()) { pointTotal += levelOne.getPoints(); if (levelTwo.goalReached()) { pointTotal += levelTwo.getPoints(); if (levelThree.goalReached()) { pointTotal += levelThree.getPoints(); } } } if (isBonus()) { pointTotal *= 3; } return pointTotal; } . Questions: . Why are objects not defined to call goalReached and getPoints? | . After some researching, I learned from this video that if methods are in the same class (isBonus and getScore are in the same class), an object does not need to be created to call the method. . #1b . public int playManyTimes(int num) { int scores[]; int maxScore = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) { play(); scores[i] = getScore(); } for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) { if (scores[i] &gt; maxScore) { maxScore = scores[i]; } } return maxScore; } . An array wasn&#39;t needed. All you had to do was compare the scores within the for loop like this: . public int playManyTimes(int num) { int maxScore = 0; int score = 0; for (int i = 0; i &lt; num; i++) { play(); score = getScore(); if (score &gt; maxScore) { maxScore = score; } } return maxScore; } . . 2016 #1a . Initial thoughts: . When I first read the question, I did not know where to start, so I looked at part of the answers to guide me on what to learn. . Looking at this, . . I was confused as to what List&lt;String&gt; was, so I googled it. . I learned that List&lt;String&gt; is used to make an object that can store the array list. For instance, List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); . I also saw how an array list can also be created with ArrayList&lt;String&gt;. The difference between ArrayList&lt;String&gt; and List&lt;String&gt; is that with List&lt;String&gt;, you can typecast the array list into a different type of list; however, you can&#39;t do that with ArrayList&lt;String&gt;. . The code below is what I got started with before I became stuck again. . public class RandomStringChooser { private List&lt;String&gt; words; public RandomStringChooser(String[] wordArray) { words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); } } . Once again not knowing how to proceed, I took a look at the answers and came upon this: . . Because I had no idea what the syntax meant, I hopped onto Google and did some searching. . So, for (String singleWord : wordArray) is an example of a for-each loop. A for-each loop allows you to loop through the elements in an array list. . Below is a simple example of a for-each loop: . public class ForEachDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { List&lt;String&gt; fruits = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;pineapple&quot;, &quot;mango&quot;)); for (String i : fruits) { System.out.println(i); } } } ForEachDemo.main(null); . apple pineapple mango . This essentially creates is the same as using a regular for loop, and printing out each index in the array list using .get. .get returns the element specified in the index number. . public class GetDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { List&lt;String&gt; fruits = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(Arrays.asList(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;pineapple&quot;, &quot;mango&quot;)); // same as: // for (String i : fruits) { // System.out.println(i); // } for (int i = 0; i &lt; fruits.size(); i++) { System.out.println(fruits.get(i)); } } } GetDemo.main(null); . apple pineapple mango . The code below is my continued attempt at answering 1a, after learning about the for-each loop. . public class RandomStringChooser { private List&lt;String&gt; words; // creating an object words public RandomStringChooser(String[] wordArray) { words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); // assigning words to a new array list for (String singleWord : wordArray) { // add all of the elements in wordArray to words words.add(singleWord); } public String getNext() { return words.remove((int)(Math.random() * words.size())); } } } . This was close, but I forgot that NONE should be the output once all of the elements in the array list have been used. The correct answer is: . public class RandomStringChooser { private List&lt;String&gt; words; // creating an object words public RandomStringChooser(String[] wordArray) { words = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(); // assigning words to a new array list for (String singleWord : wordArray) { // add all of the elements in wordArray to words words.add(singleWord); } public String getNext() { // forgot to write an if statement if (words.size() &gt; 0) { return words.remove((int)(Math.random() * words.size())); } return &quot;NONE&quot;; } } } . Concluding thoughts . This question was hard mainly because I had no idea what an array list was prior to doing this question. Although I looked at the answer key a few times, I researched all of the code that I did not understand to help me learn what an array list was, how to create it, and how to use iteration with array lists. . . 1b . Explanation: . If I&#39;m understanding correctly, when the object letterChooser is created, the RandomLetterChooser constructor will run. Since we want to create an array of strings, we would use the super keyword to call the getSingleLetters method, which will split the word into an array of strings. Then, System.out.print(letterChooser.getNext()); is ran, which will call the superclass&#39;s constructor and then run the getNext method. This will randomly output the characters. . The code below matched the answer key. . However, one thing that I wondered as I was examining the answer was, why was there no super() in RandomLetterChooser, which would call the superclass (RandomStringChooser). The answer, after some googling, told me that even if you don&#39;t type super(), the superclass will still implicitly be called. . public RandomLetterChooser(String str) { super(getSingleLetters(str)); } .",

Input: User input would be typing into a text box of their tasks for the day. User will also specify a certain amount of hours that they have to work that day. . | List: The user input of assignments will be stored into a list that contains all of the tasks. . | Procedure and algorithm: Most likely to calculate the amount of time each task should be spent on . | Output: Output will be a calculation of how long each task should be spent on for the day. Output may also give certain times to do the task. . | . . A few other notes: . The program will most likely start by equally dividing the total time amongst all activities. By entering more input, the user is able to change how many hours they want to spend on a task based on the task&#39;s priority. | . Plans for AP MCQ .

            "content": "Here is the link to my app. . Subject . Since I’m in AP Stats, I decided to create a statistics quiz. . Questions . What is the mean of the following set of numbers: 5, 8, 9, 15, 16? | Normal distribution picture: What percent of data lies between one standard deviation of the mean? | A class of 30 students were surveyed on how many hours they sleep. The average was 7 hours with a standard deviation of 1.5 hours. What percentage of students sleep less than 8 hours? | Initial planning with partner . Shreyas and I planned out a general format for how we would make our individual apps. . We planned out four stages to make the app: design, brainstorm, implementation, and finishing. . We both created quizzes with three questions. Some of the code that we planned on excessive use was the onEvent function, which allowed an action to happen, such as switching the screen, given that something has occured, such as the click of a button. . Design . My app consists of six screens: Homepage, questions 1-3, end screen, and a finish screen. . Below are some pictures of what the initial design looked like: . . . After the initial design, I made a few revisions, namely changing the font, adding buttons (originally, the user had to click the screen), and adding radio buttons for the multiple choice selection. . An intermediate photo where I added a button: . . One of my screens on the final design: . . Coding . My code is relatively simple. A majority of the code used the onEvent function. I used the function for two purposes, the first was to change the screen when the Next button was pressed, and the second was to increase the score if the correct multiple choice was selected. . . Something else I made additionally was the use of a list that recorded if the user answered each individual question correctly. At the end of the quiz, the person would be able to receive feedback on what they answered correctly and anything that they could improve on, if needed. . I accomplished this by creating a list with the name of questionRight. The index of the array corresponded to the question, so if the user answered correctly on the first question, questionRight[0] would have a value of 1. At the end of the quiz, the questions that had a value of 1 would have a congratulations message, and the questions that had a value of 0 (incorrect) would have an explanation on how to arrive at the correct answer. . Explanations of code . This is a screenshot of part of my code. The rest of my code followed basically the same format. If you wish to check out my code, you can do so here. . . Here’s how the code works: . The first block of code is an onEvent function, in which when the next button (q1ButtonNext) was pressed, the app screen will change to the next question (q2Screen). . The second block of code is another onEvent function. This time though, when choice B is selected (q1ButtonB), a predefined variable score will increase by 1. . . Now I’ll give an overview on the use of a list in my app. First, I created a list called questionRight that contains three elements, each with the value 0. . . Later on in the code, if the user selects the correct answer choice for the button, the value of the element would become 1. . . At the end of the code, I used an if-else statement to decide which feedback message to show. If the element of the index is 0, the feedback for the wrong answer would be show; otherwise, the feedback, for the correct message would show. . . I could use individual variables in the code, but I used a list partially in preparation for the AP CSP Create Task. I think using a list would help in that if the quiz had more questions, using a list would be more organized than creating an individual variable for each question. . Things I learned . The code I encountered in AppLab was new to me. I used the documentation 1 very frequently. . I had to learn most of the things I coded. The most important code that I learned was the onEvent function. You can use it to specify an action to do when a certain event occurs, such as the press of a button. . Documentation 1 and 2 &#8617; . |",

Set: A group of objects | Universal set: A set that has all of the elements | Subsets: Contains elements from the universal set | Complement: For example, if we have set A, the complement of set A would have the elements in the universal set, but not in set A. | Union: New set has elements from both sets . Symbol: ∪ . | Intersection: New sets has elements that are shared between both sets . Symbol: ∩ . | . De Morgan&#39;s Law is used in boolean algebra to help simplify expressions (this is important, remember this for later). . De Morgan&#39;s Law of Union states that: &quot;The complement of the union of the two sets A and B will be equal to the intersection of A&#39; (complement of A) and B&#39; (complement of B).&quot; 1 . Formula: (A ∪ B)&#39; = A&#39;∩ B&#39; . De Morgan&#39;s Law of Intersection states that: &quot;The complement of the intersection of A and B will be equal to the union of A&#39; and B&#39;.&quot; 2 . Formula: (A ∩ B)’ = A’ ∪ B’ . . The following is an example: . Universal set: {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9} Set A: {1, 3} Set B: {5, 6, 8} . De Morgan&#39;s Law of Union: (A ∪ B)&#39; = {9} . A&#39;∩ B&#39; = {9} . (A ∪ B)&#39; = A&#39;∩ B&#39; . De Morgan&#39;s Law of Intersection: (A ∩ B)&#39; = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9} . A’ ∪ B’ = {1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9} . (A ∩ B)’ = A’ ∪ B’ . . Now how is this useful? . Remember this? . . Translating De Morgan&#39;s law into code, De Morgan&#39;s Law of Union would mean: !(a || b) = (!a &amp;&amp; !b). . De Morgan&#39;s Law of Intersection means: !(a &amp;&amp; b) = (!a || !b) 3 . 1. Reference↩ . 2. Reference↩ . 3. Reference↩ . Example in Coding . because what would De Morgan&#39;s law be if it&#39;s not applicable to coding? . public class DeMorgansLaw{ public static void main(String[] args) { boolean rainy = false; boolean sunny = false; if (!!!(rainy || sunny) &amp;&amp; ((!rainy &amp;&amp; !sunny) || !(!(rainy || sunny))) ) { System.out.println(&quot;It&#39;s a cloudy day, not too hot, not too cold&quot;); } } } DeMorgansLaw.main(null) . It&#39;s a cloudy day, not too hot, not too cold . Well this is awfully confusing, how about we clean it up a little? . First, remove all of the !! (negative + negative = positive) . This code reads: If it&#39;s not rainy or sunny, and: it&#39;s not rainy and it&#39;s not sunny OR it&#39;s rainy or sunny . Evaluating each part of the code: . If it&#39;s not rainy or sunny: True | If it&#39;s not rainy and it&#39;s not sunny: True | It&#39;s rainy or sunny: False | 2. and 3. are OR, therefore, it is True. . 1. is ANDed to 2. and 3. which is True. -&gt; True AND True is true, therefore, the message is outputted. . public class DeMorgansLaw{ public static void main(String[] args) { boolean rainy = false; boolean sunny = false; if (!(rainy || sunny) &amp;&amp; ((!rainy &amp;&amp; !sunny) || (rainy || sunny)) ) { System.out.println(&quot;It&#39;s a cloudy day, not too hot, not too cold&quot;); } } } DeMorgansLaw.main(null) . It&#39;s a cloudy day, not too hot, not too cold . More examples: .

Explanation of what the code does: . I first added three entries into the dictionary. Keys include FirstName, LastName, and some others that I created, such as Hobbies and Sports played. . I used a for loop to print the records from the dictionary. The for loop ranges from 0 to the length of the dictionary, in this example, 2.

Learning . The purpose of lists and dictionaries are to collect information. . Add to dictionaries with .append(). . Dictionaries consist of key/value pairs.

Lists and dictionaries are the first step to learning about databases. . Code that I learned . d_rec: Stands for dictionary record.

Answer: ? Incorrect! The correct answer is: expression Your total score is: 6 out of 8 . How the rest of this post will be structured . This post captures my learnings from this page. . I will first document my learnings, and then display the code and its output below. . . In programming languages, a lot of the things within parenthesis are called parameters. . For example, in the code below, Hello World! would be an argument. . Static text: Text that stays the same. . print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) . Hello World! . . Input and output . This is known as dynamic, versus static. Dynamic means that a variable can change each time you run the code. For example, each time you run the code, the input could change. . In Python code, the things specified in parenthesis are known as parameters. For example, in the code below, usr_input is a parameter. . usr_input = input(&quot;Enter some text: &quot;) print(usr_input) . hi :) . . Function . Note: Indentation matters in Python . When creating a function, make sure to indent to tell Python which lines of code belong within the function (since Python does not use curly braces to delineate functions). . Functions are created with the def keyword. . def addNum(a, b): return int(a) + int(b) num1 = input(&quot;Enter 1st number: &quot;) print(&quot;Enter 1st number: &quot; + num1) num2 = input(&quot;Enter 2nd number: &quot;) print(&quot;Enter 2nd number: &quot; + num2) total = addNum(num1, num2) print(&quot;Your total is: &quot; + str(total)) . Enter 1st number: 1 Enter 2nd number: 2 Your total is: 3 . . Libraries . Libraries can be imported with the - you guessed it - import function. . Examples of libraries include getpass and sys. . import getpass import sys print(&quot;You are: &quot; + getpass.getuser()) print(&quot;Your Python interpreter is running at the file path: &quot; + sys.executable) passwd = getpass.getpass(prompt=&#39;Enter the password. Hint: what language does this program run in? &#39;) print(&quot;Enter the password. Hint: what language does this program run in? &quot;) print(passwd) if passwd == &quot;python&quot;: print(&quot;Welcome! &quot; + getpass.getuser()) else: print(&quot;Incorrect!&quot;) .

Maybe if I have time, I’ll look into it. . . I reverted the theme back to minima. However, I wanted to change the background to something cool, maybe like a gradient. I used Vunsh’s blog as a starting point and used his dark mode .scss file (thanks!). Then, I changed the background color to a gradient using the linear-gradient command within the html, body, input, textarea, select, button block. . That’s pretty much all I changed.

Here are my comments on some of the code. . . Some thoughts . I like the new theme, but I think there’s some things that I could change. . For instance, I don’t really like the font colors for the code here: . . However, this class isn’t mainly focused around CSS, so I’ll probably change the font colors only if I have time. . Table . Alright, I’m going to be honest. This took me hours to figure out, mainly because I had errors in my Liquid syntax because I forgot to include a space ╥﹏╥. . This is the page where I created my table and linked my weekly assignments. . I started off with a for loop using the {% for i in ([start num]..[end num]) %} template, where i is the week number. I then created each row in the table starting with the week number by printing {{i}}. I also used if statements ({% if i == # %}) and printed the links to my pages depending on the value of i. So if i == 0, I would print the links to Week 0, etc. .",

And I thought, hey, this is interesting, what does {{site.baseurl}} do? . After some googling, I found that {{site.baseurl}} wasn’t something in Markdown. Turns out it’s actually Jekyll syntax. . So what does {{site.baseurl}} do? . Basically, baseurl is the directory under the URL of the website. 1 So for example, this blog’s URL is lwu1822.github.io, and the baseurl is fastpages. . So I can just do ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/diagram.png). Saves a lot of typing. . Pretty cool, huh? 😊 . . Something else I encountered while making this post . To type {{site.baseurl}} in this Markdown file, apparently you have to use the {% raw %} and {% endraw %} template around {{site.baseurl}} . 2 . Like this: . {% raw %} {{site.baseurl}} {% endraw %} . . Also something I encountered just as I was writing the line above . Notice how I was able to write {% endraw %} above? Unfortunately, it’s not that simple to just type it directly into your IDE, like this: . :warning: Warning: Don’t do this, it will break your code: . {% raw %} {% endraw %} {% endraw %} . The reason is because the first {% endraw %} will be interpreted as ending the {% raw %} template. . So if you want to be able to type {% endraw %} in Markdown, you need to do the following 3: . Create a variable, in this example, I’ll name it openTag, and assign it to {%: . {% assign openTag = &#39;{%&#39; %} . | Use the {{ openTag }} variable anytime you want to type text that contains {% in it. . For example, to type the text {% endraw %}, you would do: . {{ openTag }} endraw %} . | . Even more something that I learned . Apparently, you also can’t type {% directly in the IDE, which would also break your code (took me a long time to debug （ꐦ𝅒_𝅒）) . Instead, you have to type: {{ openTag }} . . Things for me to contemplate on: . I noticed on the provided Fastpages Notebook Blog Post, you can add an image without the baseurl. For example, you can specify an image with ![](images/diagram.png). Not sure why that works, but I’m guessing it has something to with Jupyter Notebooks. . . baseurl &#8617; . | Liquid template language &#8617; . | I took the steps from here but quite frankly, I found the explanation a little confusing, so I simplified it as much as I could in this blog &#8617; . |",

            "content": "Takeaways . From today’s alumni panel event, I learned about the significance and prevalence of computer science. The skills learned in AP CSA and AP CSP are very applicable and can be used to solve real world problems. However, programmers face many difficulties in their coding career. For instance, Colin described about the constant error messages that are bound to show up while coding, which can leave a negative effect and greatly decrease motivation. One thing that really struck out to me, however, was the importance of google. Basically, any programming question you have can be solved by this very magical tool. Furthermore, PBLs not only occur in this class, but can also be found in colleges. For instance, Colin mentioned that in UCSD’s mechanical engineering, students will be tasked with a hands on project in their freshmen and senior year. The same methodologies still apply - scrum team and agile. Furthermore, not only is coding applied in CS majors, it is also used in other majors. For instance, Allison mentioned that stats majors are also required to program in R. A really cool example of where you could apply your coding knowledge was scripting. If you’re ever frustrated at repeating the same redundant tasks over and over again, hey- maybe try some automation :). Last but not least, a very important part of the event was the discussion of internships. Some tips that were brought up was to build a resume and to create some personal projects that demonstrate your passion for coding. Additionally, interaction with professors and TAs are a good idea to find research and programming opportunities. . . Notes that I took during the event . Challenge with compsci: . Error msg -&gt; keep motivation? | GOOGLE | Ego: People brag about internship Focus on own path | Work on own project | . | Learn computer theory in college (it’s different from high school programming) | Motivation: There’s always someone better than you | Don’t cut corner: Have a mindset to go above and beyond | Getting started There is no rigid structure telling you what to do | Don’t get restricted by your plan - be flexible | . | . Any PBL scenario in college? . UCSD mechanical engineering: 1 hands on project freshman and senior year Need to use scrum and agile flow | . | Study in group and work with other people | Learn what’s the best method to study | . Have you applied CS in your major if your major is not CS? . Convert data type, copy paste, manually -&gt; write script!! ;) | Matlab for mechanical student | Problem solving logic, working with Matlab | Jupyter notebook for technical paper | Stats majors: Program in R | . Existing college students, have you had a job with school/professor . Make a resume, talk with other students, find a way to stand out, what makes you unique? | Interact with a professor, ask if they have space in their labs | Interact with TAs | . Job/internships . Code Ninjas | Northrop Grumman | . Personal projects? . Companies look for personal projects | Have 2 or 3? | Visual projects are great | . Internships: .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .
