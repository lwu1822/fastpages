Primitives include: int, double, boolean . String is not a primitive. . Code: Integer: int a . Double: double a . Boolean: boolean a . String: String a . . Useful stuff learned while creating calculator: . if and while statements: . If the variable is an integer/double, you can use == . If the variable is a string, you must use .equals . Example: &quot;foo&quot;.equals(variableName) . . Playing with Code from Primitive Data Types . public class test { public static void main(String[] args) { int x = 5; System.out.println(&quot;This is an integer: &quot; + x); } } test.main(null) . This is an integer: 5 .",

Jupyter Notebook is an environment that allows you to create cells that can contain various types of code, including Python and Markdown. . Now, you might be wondering, why do I need this? . Well, there&#39;s a few reasons: . Jupyter Notebook is interactive. It allows you to move your program around. | What if you want to test a portion of your code? Instead of running the entire thing, you could use Jupyter Notebook to run code snippets. | . . Below is some testing of using Jupyter Notebook.

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .
