## Primitives

Primitives: Includes the data types of int, double, and boolean.

**Note: String is not a primitive**

### Basic code:

Data types:

`int [var]`, `double [var]`, `boolean [var]`, and `String [var]`

Input:

`Scanner [var] = new Scanner(System.in);` : Create a scanner object with a name of `[var]`, set it equal to `System.in`, which is what the user inputs on the keyboard.
