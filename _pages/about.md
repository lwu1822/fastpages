Hi, and welcome to my blog!
My name is Lily Wu. I'm a junior at Del Norte High School.

My interests are in STEM, which include programming, cybersecurity, and math.

I'm passionate about learning, and I love to play around with code.

In my free time, I also love to read. Feel free to give me some book suggestions! :)
