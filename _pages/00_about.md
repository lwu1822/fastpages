Hi, and welcome to my blog!

My name is Lily Wu. I'm a junior at Del Norte High School.

My interests are in STEM, including programming, cybersecurity, and math.

I’m passionate about learning, and I love to play around and explore code.

I don’t know if this is a good thing, but I have a bad habit of falling down a rabbit hole as I look up what each code syntax does specifically.

I have some experience in C++, and am currently learning Python and Java.
