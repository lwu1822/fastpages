    "## Setting Up GitHub Pages\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of you may have come to know that GitHub Pages is starting to become outdated. So why do we still use it? The answer is that we are in a class, and following a curriculum with something like GitHub Pages is much easier than creating portfolio content from scratch, which becomes quite unecessary. Therefore, we can use GitHub Pages to create this content instead. On the topic of unecessary vs necessary coding, we don't need to make GitHub Pages from scratch as opposed to using a template that our very own Mr. Mortensen created for us. To do that, we can go to the [Leuck Reunion](https://github.com/jm1021/leuck_reunion) repository and use the template to make our own GitHub Pages. Then, in Ubuntu, we can ```git clone``` our repository and open it in VSCode. After we have it open, the last thing we want to do is set up local hosting for this website, so that we can preview it and make changes in real time. To do that, head [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/) to install Jekyll for Ubuntu, [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) to install Ruby next, and [here](https://bundler.io/) to finalize the process by installing Bundler."

To do that, we can use Fastpages, which is what we have been using to show our blogs, code, and projects. However, Fastpages has been deprecated for some time now, so the instructions in Week 0 won't be effective. So, we need to fork the APCSP Fastpages. To do that, follow [this]() video to get started developing with Fastpages."
