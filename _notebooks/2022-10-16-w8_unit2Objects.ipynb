    "Comments: I started off alright; however, I was soon stuck at the for loop part. I knew that I had to use a for loop to perform iteration that will compare the substring to `secret`, but I did not know how to compare to certain characters within a string. After looking at part of the answers, I found that the program utilized the `substring()` method, which I did not know what it did. After some googling, I applied my knowledge to the code below in my second attempt. "

    "Comments: This attempt mostly matched the answer key. One thing that I did wrong, however, was that in my comparison in the `if` statement, I used `==` instead of `.equals`. I have seen `.equals()` before, but I have never used it, so once again, I had to do some googling. I learned that if you want to compare two objects, you would need to use the `.equals()` method. In this case, `secret` is an object, as indicated by this line of code: `private String secret;`"
