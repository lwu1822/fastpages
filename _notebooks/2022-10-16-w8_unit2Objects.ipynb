    "## Learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "This unit had some very important learnings for me. The first thing that I learned was that if two strings are created in the format of `String string1 = new String(\"string\")`, the `.equals()` method should be used to compare them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing that I learned was that there is a way to compare if the attributes of two objects are the same using the `.equals()` method. However, this requires some manual overriding of the `.equals()` method **because by default, `.equals()` works the same as `==`, which compares the object memory address**. You can still compare if two objects are the same object with `==`."

    "\n",
    "Objects are instances of a class. There are three steps to create an object: **declaration, instantiation, and initialization**. Declaration is specified through a type followed by the variable name. Instantiation instantiates the object with the `new` keyword. Initialization occurs the name of the constructor method is specified after the `new` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating objects\n",
    "The syntax to create objects is: <code><em>Class-name</em> <em>object-name</em> = new <em>constructor-name</em></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "Methods are defined with a return type (int, bool, etc. or void (no return type)) and the method name.\n",

    "## Static vs non static\n",
    "A static method can only access other static methods, while a nonstatic method can access both static and nonstatic methods.\n",
