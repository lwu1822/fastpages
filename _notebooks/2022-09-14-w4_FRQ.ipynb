    "If I'm understanding correctly, when the object `letterChooser` is created, the `RandomLetterChooser` constructor will run. Since we want to create an array of strings, we would use the `super` keyword to call the `getSingleLetters` method, which will split the word into an array of strings. Then, `System.out.print(letterChooser.getNext());` is ran, which will call the superclass's constructor and then run the `getNext` method. This will randomly output the characters.\n",

The answer, after some googling, told me that even if you don't type `super()`, the superclass will still implicitly be called. "
