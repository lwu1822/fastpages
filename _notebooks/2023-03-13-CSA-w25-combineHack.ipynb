    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "* A **method** is a block of code which only runs when it's called\n",
    "  * **Parameters**, or data can be passed into a method\n",
    "* Methods are used to perform certain actions. Another word for them is a **function**\n",
    "* See more information on methods [here](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control Structures\n",
    "* **Control structure** are blocks of code that can change the path of execution. There are 3 kinds of control structures:\n",
    "  1.  **Condiditional Branches** - used for choosing between 2+ paths (`if/else` statements)\n",
    "  2.  **Loops** - used it iterate through multiple values/objects and repeatedly run specific code blocks (`for`, `while`, and `do while` loops)\n",
    "  3.  **Branching Statements** - used to break the flow of control in loops (`break` and `continue`)\n",
    "* See more information on control structures [here](https://www.baeldung.com/java-control-structures)\n",

    "\n",
    "An array called `nums` is created and set to `{1, 3, 4, 5, 5}`. The data type is the primitive data type `int`. An `int` of name `value` is also created and set to `6`. A data type (but not wrapper class) of `String` with name `name` is created and set to `blackboard`. The code outputs `Do Nothings` and executes the `changeIt` method, passing in `nums`, `value`, and `name`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `changeIt()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the `changeIt` method, the argument `nums` relates to the parameter `arr`, `value` to `val`, and `name` to `word`. `arr` is created to have 5 elements, `val` is set to 0, and `word` is set to a substring of the `word` argumenent of `blackboard`. As such, `word` is set to `black`. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, before the variables are reassigned to new values, <mark>the arguments were passed into the method's parameters</mark>. For instance, if I use a for loop to output the values of `arr`, I get `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, not `0, 0, 0, 0, 0`.\n",

    "\n",
    "In `changeIt2()`, the arguments are passed in as parameters of `nums`, `value`, and `name`. Notice how these parameters have the same name as the arguments. Based on the comment in the file, we can see that the name of the parameter can be the same as the arguments' names. \n",

    "What's important is that when you go back to `main()`, the for loop after `changeIt2()` outputs all of the original values of `nums`, `value`, and `name`. This is because <mark>Java is pass-by-value for methods</mark>, which means that the variable's values are passed into the method, NOT the reference. On the other hand, <mark>pass-by-reference allows you to edit the contents of a variable because the **reference** to the variable is passed</mark>.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### `changeIt3()`\n",
    "Within the `changeIt3()` method, you can see that the parameter `word` (passed in as argument `name`) is assigned to a `new String`. A simplified way of writing this would be `word = word.substring(0, 5)`. Both ways work because the shorthand for creating wrapper classes is directly assigning the class to a value; however, behind the scenes, an object is still created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this method, each element of the array is modified to `0`, and the `word` is modified to `limit`.\n",

    "#### `main()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to `main()` again, the elements of `nums2` are printed out. <mark>The edited elements from `changeIt3()` are present because arrays are objects, and the value of an object is its reference</mark>.\n",
