    "I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfzpMASeNHg) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h51o7IqY4vQ) to learn more about the requirements for the create task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes that I took down for future reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The code can be written in any programming language that satisfies the requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Requirements include having: input, list that manages complexity, procedure with algorithm, a call to the procedure, and output\n",
    "\n",
    "* A video demonstrating the code will also be required. Within the video, you will need to show at least one input and output and the program's function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Speaking of functions, there is a difference between the word \"function\" and \"purpose\":\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: The problem that is being solved/something that you pursue for a creative interest\n",
    "\n",
    "* Function: How the program acts when you run it\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "While we're at it, some other vocab that I was unfamiliar with {% fn 1 %}:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Procedure: Same thing as function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Algorithm: Code that performs a specific action\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, back to the notes:\n",
    " \n",
    "* In addition to the code and a video, you will also need to submit a written response. A written response consists of four parts, questions 3a-3d. \n",
    "\n",
    "* 3a. You will be writing about the program's purpose. Why did you create this program? You will also be documenting the program's function. **Remember**: Function and purpose are two different things!\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3b. How does your list manage complexity?\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3c. What does your procedure do, and make sure to talk about your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3d. Testing! Make two different test scenarios for your code.\n",
