    "An array called `nums` is created and set to `{1, 3, 4, 5, 5}`. The data type is the primitive data type `int`. An `int` of name `value` is also created and set to `6`. A data type (but not wrapper class) of `String` with name `name` is created and set to `blackboard`. The code outputs `Do Nothings` and executes the `changeIt` method, passing in `nums`, `value`, and `name`. \n",

A simplified way of writing this would be `word = word.substring(0, 5)`. Both ways work because the shorthand for creating wrapper classes is directly assigning the class to a value; however, behind the scenes, an object is still created. \n",
