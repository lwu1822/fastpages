Next, a scanner object can be created with <code>Scanner <em>object name</em> = new Scanner(System.in)</code>. To take in input, specify the data type that the scanner takes in with <code>scanner.next<em>data type</em></code>"

    "Objects are instances of a class. There are three steps to create an object: **declaration, instantiation, and initialization**.

Initialization occurs the name of the constructor method is specified after the `new` keyword.\n",
