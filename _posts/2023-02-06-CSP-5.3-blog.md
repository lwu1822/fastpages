Different social media platforms are focused towards different age groups. For instance, Facebook is more oriented towards older people while TikTok is focused towards younger age groups. Therefore, content may be biased on these two platforms because they are more suited towards what the age group would like. Although the content may be different, it may be alright for these two platforms to be oriented towards different age groups because two different generations have different preferences and customs. Therefore, being on different platforms would allow them to access content that they are more used to. 

Virtual assistants have female voices probably because they are viewed as more soothing. They may also follow typical steoreotypes. There are options to change the virtual assitant voice to a male voice, so that is good. 

Algorithms are created on social media platforms in order to keep users on the website. They can find what topics the user is interested in and keep showing posts releated to that topic. 

From the HP Computers video, I learned the importance of ensuring that development can be accessible to everyone. Additionally, lots of testing should be conducted in order to make sure that the product does not have any flaws and is not biased. 

## Crowdsourcing

A crowdsourcing idea could be to randomly select computer science students across all AP CSP classes and conduct a survey/test.

With Del Norte, a random sample could again be selected. This ensures a sample that is more representative of the population and can reduce bias. 

A data could be a feedback form that allows different people to enter of what they thought about our project.
