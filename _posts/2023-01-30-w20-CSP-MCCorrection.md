My score is 49/50.

The question that I got wrong was #45. The question asks for the benefit of a heuristic approach. I answered that it shouldbe used when the problem can be solved in a reasonable time. The correct answer was that if it **cannot** be solved in a reasonable time. This is correct because a heuristic approach is used to simplify a complex problem. Usually, these problems would be difficult to solve in a short amount of time.
