# Takeaways
From today's alumni panel event, I learned about the significance and prevalence of computer science. The skills learned in AP CSA and AP CSP are very applicable and can be used to solve real world problems. However, programmers face many difficulties in their coding career. For instance, Colin described about the constant error messages that are bound to show up while coding, which can leave a negative effect and greatly decrease motivation. One thing that really struck out to me, however, was the importance of **google**. Basically, any programming question you have can be solved by this very magical tool. Furthermore, PBLs not only occur in this class, but can also be found in colleges. For instance, Colin mentioned that in UCSD's mechanical engineering, students will be tasked with a hands on project in their freshmen and senior year. The same methodologies still apply - scrum team and agile. Furthermore, not only is coding applied in CS majors, it is also used in other majors. For instance, Allison mentioned that stats majors are also required to program in R. A really cool example of where you could apply your coding knowledge was **scripting**. If you're ever frustrated at repeating the same redundant tasks over and over again, hey- maybe try some automation :). Last but not least, a very important part of the event was the discussion of internships. Some tips that were brought up was to build a resume and to create some personal projects that demonstrate your passion for coding. Additionally, interaction with professors and TAs are a good idea to find research and programming opportunities.
