Night at the Museum takes place at the end of every trimester to showcase studentsâ€™ work from various classes. There were many exhibitions that you could view, the ones that I went to were the 3D Animations classroom, ceramics, and AP Studio Art rooms. 

In the ceramics class, there were a lot of creative items that included mugs and other containers, such as this item which had the design of ocean waves:

My favorite piece from the ceramics classroom was a mug in the shape of a dragon:

The artwork in the AP Studio Art classroom had a lot of variety. Some that I found interesting were this drawing of a cat.

Another piece of artwork that I really liked was this drawing of an eye because of how realistic it looked.

I also went to the 3D Animations classroom to view their projects. 3D Animations is special to me because I took the class last year, so the projects felt really familiar to me. 

For APCSA, our team presented our crime prevention project. 

For APCSA, our team presented our dictionary project. Another group's project that I enjoyed playing around with was the Swag Team's "Math Games". The game that I played with was their blackjack game, and i won both rounds :)
