Night at the Museum takes place at the end of every trimester to showcase studentsâ€™ work from various classes. There were many exhibitions that you could view, the ones that I went to were the 3D Animations classroom, ceramics, and AP Studio Art rooms. 

My favorite piece from the ceramics classroom was a mug in the shape of a dragon:

The artwork in the AP Studio Art classroom had a lot of variety. Some that I found interesting were this drawing of a cat.
