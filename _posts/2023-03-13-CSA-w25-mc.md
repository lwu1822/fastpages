My score is 36/39.

The question that I got wrong was #29. I did not choose the right answer because the wording in the answer of "decimal" made me believe that the input number was a decimal number, which didn't make sense to me. After looking at the answer explanation, I understand that the method counts the number of digits in the input. This makes sense because this is a recursive function, so the method wouldn't only reuturn 1 (what I had selected before). 


I also got #35 wrong. The reason why I got this problem wrong was because I mistakenly believed that the calculations round up. When calculating the first midpoint, the result is 3.5, and I rounded to 4. Instead, you need to round down to 3, which will lead to the correct midpoint on the second iteration.

I got 39 wrong because I did not how the set method worked in `System.out.println`. After reading the explanations, I learned that the set method returns the original value when it is called. Therefore, the original elements of the ArrayList are outputted before the elements are changed.
