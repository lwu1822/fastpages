1. People can empower themselves through the digital world by using the resources that are offered digitally. This can come in a variety of forms; for instance, people can use resources online to learn about topics that would have been very hard to access. Other people have also been able to take advantage of social media and create content that many people love.

2. Those who are empowered can share their knowledge to help others. This is relevant to the digital world, because anyone can create a blog and start writing what they know. At Del Norte, we can empower each other by working together as a team so that we are able to improve together. We can also help out each other when one is confused.

3. It could be possible that red tape can block digital empowerment because lots of paperwork can make things harder to accomplish. For example, in companies, paperwork is needed before something can be developed. This could hinder digital empowerment as projects need to be first approved before they can be created.
