1. People can empower themselves through the digital world by using the resources that are offered digitally. This can come in a variety of forms; for instance, people can use resources online to learn about topics that would have been very hard to access. Other people have also been able to take advantage of social media and create content that many people love.

2. Those who are empowered can share their knowledge to help others. This is relevant to the digital world, because anyone can create a blog and start writing what they know. At Del Norte, we can empower each other by working together as a team so that we are able to improve together. We can also help out each other when one is confused.

3. I do not think paper blocks digital empowerment. In my opinion, although there are many tasks that can be performed both on paper and computers, such as taking notes, there are also functions that only one media can accomplish. For instance, coding can only be achieved through a computer and not with paper. Furthermore, the general trend is that people will be moving towards becoming more digitalized. Generally places lacking access to technology would be negatively affected, but I do not think that the cause of this is paper.
