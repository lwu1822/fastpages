Reflection:



* Ashley: Major in physics
* Persisted despite failures -> starting PhD this year
* Test scores don't define you
* Use computer science in other STEM fields

* John: Transfer from Palomar to Cal State San Marcos
* Degree in math, physics, and engineering

* Cal State San Marcos: Newer college
* National leader in social mobility (internship oppurtunities)
* Pathways: 
  * Chemistry
  * Physics
  * Biological Science
  * Computer science, Computer information systems, Cybersecurity, Computer engineering
    * Easy to transition between majors
  * Math
  * Electrical engineering
  * Software engineering
* Lots of STEM clubs

* Internships:
  * How to find: Join clubs, check emails, **campus events**, google
  * Tips: Try to avoid unpaid internships
    * Apply even if you feel underqualified
    * Ask faculty members for help with applications
    * Ask writing centers for help

* Programs:
  * Summer scholar program: Research program
  * Quantum bridge program

* Research: STEM (physics, CS, bio)

* Grant vs. scholarship: Grant is government funded, scholarship is privatly funded 
* Look for scholarships yourself
* Grants depend on parents' salary + grades
* Loans: 
  * Unsubsidized loan: Need to pay interest on loan instantly
  * Subsidized loan: Loan partially funded by the government (have some time before need to pay interest)
* FAFSA

* Life after college:
  * Graduate school
  * Educator
