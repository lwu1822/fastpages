# Our Aim

We want to prioritize the customer before anything else; here's how this will be done:
1. Our website will run smoothly with minimal errors
2. Try to keep our website as engaging as possible
3. Listen to reviews and make changes as necessary
4. Make the results accurate

# About the Project

In this project, we are making a reverse dictionary. We were inspired by many students' studious and driven culture and wanted to create a site that could help them. A problem that we noticed among many students, especially those in advanced English courses, is that they often don't know or can't remember the word they want to use. Through the use of this website, we want to help these students allowing them to do well where ever they choose to use this website.

# How is This Done

In order to achieve this, we first need to get a basic understanding of how reverse dictionaries work and how to code them. After searching on Google, we came across many fascinating sites, some even explaining the basics of a reverse dictionary. Essentially it is looking for an output similar to the combination of the inputs. One of our ideas was to make the user input either the definition of the word or other words related to the word they need. For example, if you're searching for the word "apple," you can input "fruit," "red," and "grows on trees" to get your result. And currently, we are planning to code most of this with Python, use HTML to display everything, and use JavaScript to allow the user to interact with the results.
