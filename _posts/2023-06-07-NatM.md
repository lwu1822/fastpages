Night at the Museum takes place at the end of every trimester to showcase studentsâ€™ work from various classes. 



The project that I saw from another group was a Raspberry Pi project. They built a mini computer using Raspberry Pi and had programs such as a weather forecaster. Overall, I thought the project was pretty cool because it focused a little on hardware. I forgot to take a picture though, so I don't have it to show.

This trimester, I went to N@tM early, so I got to see a lot of performances that I didn't get to see first and second tri. 

One group I saw was choir. The song that they sang was from the Wizard of Oz. They also incorporated a little drama with their performance, which made it really interesting to watch.

Another group I saw was jazz band. Their performance was really nice, and I thought it was cool to listen to music of a different style, as I haven't heard Del Norte's jazz band before.

The other exhibitions that I went to was the 3D Animations classroom. 

The picture below shows some of the projects that the 3D Animations class created.
