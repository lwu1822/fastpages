I spent about 3 hours on the MC (lost track of time because I took breaks in between)

I got #1 wrong because I thought that `num` in the for each loop would change the value of the element in the array. However, `num` is actually assigned a copy of the element, so althought the values of `num` are changed, the actual elements inside the array do not change.

I got #32 wrong because it made sense to me that `lenCount` had to reset if the elements were not consecutive anymore. However, I failed to realize that if lenCount was not larger than maxLen, `lenCount` still needed to be reset, which would not have been the case by selecting D.

No context for #36.

I answered wrong on #50 because I did not realize that `i < num1` would mean that 10 is excluded. Therefore, to print 10, the correct answer would be D, which used `20` as the bound.

I gto #52 wrong because the answer of adding a return type to the method looked very appealing. However, this does not fulfill the requirements of the method, which is to update the value of price. Therefore, `price += surcharge` would be the correct answer.
