Below is my score on the Trimester 1 AP CSP Finals.

This was the question that I got wrong:

* Why I chose the answer: I confused WWW with HTTP. HTTP is a protocol, but WWW is not. 

* Correct answer: The correct answer is that WWW is an information system that consists of linked pages, programs, and files. The Internet is a network that can access the World Wide Web.

  Reviewing the 4.1 Daily Video 2, I reviewed that the Internet helps connect the computer networks, while WWW is the "network of linked data and programs, running over the Internet". WWW **uses** the protocol HTTP.

There were also a few questions that I got correct, but I did not fully understand them. Looking at the solutions, my train of thought was about the same as the explanations, but I will include them below for future reference and review.

* My reasoning: I know that four bits in binary is equivalent to 2^4 = 16 values. Since there were 8 directions, I just assumed that each direction would be stored as a value.

* My reasoning: I knew from before that binary was the fundamental bits that could store information (0s and 1s). However, I just think it is really interesting that all data can be stored in binary, from strings to colors to audio.

* Note: This one I had no idea, so I guessed on the answer that sounded most correct.

* What I learned: Analog data changes continuously, while digital is discrete. Therefore, digital data would be sampled at regular intervals (not continuous) to approximate the runner's position.
