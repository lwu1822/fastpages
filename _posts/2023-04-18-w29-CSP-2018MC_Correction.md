The question that I got wrong was #43. I got this question wrong because I thought that number of steps was related to time complexity. It is actually related to space complexity, so since the space complexity is n^2, the time complexity would be more efficient. Therefore, the algorithm would "run in a reasonable amount of time", so the correct answer is A.

The second question that I got wrong was #47. I thought that the sender's public key would be used to decrypt the message. The actual answer was the recipient's private key.
