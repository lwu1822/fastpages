The project that I will make for MyToolkit is MyClasses, a feature that can allow students to search for classes and see others' review of them. 

## CollegeBoard Criteria

**Program Purpose and Function**: The purpose of the program is to help students in their course selection process. The function will be to let the student search for the class that they are interested in taking and show a list of reviews that other students have left for the class. Input will be the class that the student searches for and output will be the reviews for that class.

**Data Abstraction**: A list could possibly include some specific aspects of the review, such as the number of hours of homework, how many days in between each test. The data in the list could be called to display on frontend.

**Managing complexity**: The information could be taken from the list, which manages complexity because otherwise each piece of information about the review would need to be stored within variables, creating a large amount of unnecessary code.

**Proceduaral Abstraction**: The procedure would be a search function.

**Algorithm Implementation**: Within the procedure, the search function would have selection by selecting the specific class. Iteration would be used to repeatedly print out reviews.

**Testing**: The user could search different classes to have different reviews displayed.

My video would probably show a search for the class and the specific reviews for that class as the output.
