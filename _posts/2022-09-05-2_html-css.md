I changed the theme from minima to **minimal**

Overall, the minimal theme looked pretty similar to the minima theme. However, there were some problems with the new theme. 

For some reason, when my window is maximized, the contents on the webpage are displayed incorrectly.

But when I shrink my window, the contents are fine.

I'm not sure why that is the case. Maybe if I have time, I'll look into it.

I reverted the theme back to minima. However, I wanted to change the background to something cool, maybe like a gradient. I used Vunsh's [blog](https://vunsh.github.io/blogging/fastpages/jupyter/darkmode/2022/08/30/22-Darkmode.html) as a starting point and used his dark mode .scss file (thanks!). Then, I changed the background color to a gradient using the `linear-gradient` command within the `html, body, input, textarea, select, button` block. 

That's pretty much all I changed. Looking at the .scss file, there were many parts of the code that I didn't understand. By commenting and uncommenting each block of code, I was able to learn what they did. Here are my comments on some of the code.

## Some thoughts

I like the new theme, but I think there's some things that I could change. 

For instance, I don't really like the font colors for the code here:

However, this class isn't mainly focused around CSS, so I'll probably change the font colors only if I have time. 

# Table 

Alright, I'm going to be honest. This took me hours to figure out, mainly because I had errors in my Liquid syntax because I forgot to include a space ╥﹏╥.

This is the [page](https://lwu1822.github.io/CSP-fastpages/weekly-work/) where I created my table and linked my weekly assignments. 

{% raw %}
I started off with a for loop using the `{% for i in ([start num]..[end num]) %}` template, where `i` is the week number. I then created each row in the table starting with the week number by printing `{{i}}`. I also used if statements (`{% if i == # %}`) and printed the links to my pages depending on the value of `i`. So if `i == 0`, I would print the links to Week 0, etc. 

{% endraw %}
