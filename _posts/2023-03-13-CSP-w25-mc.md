My score is 50/50.

The question that I wasn't that sure on was #2. I debated between cookies and IP address compromising a person's privacy. I learned from the answer explanations that cookies are used to collect information about the user and the websites that they visit. I originally thought that an IP address would reveal a lot of information about a user, but from the explanations, I learned that an IP address is needed for a user to send and receive information. Therefore, an IP address is public and would expose less information than cookies.
