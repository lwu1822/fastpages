The theme of my CPT is class reviews. I have the main features already created, but I also have some ideas that I can add to it. 

Based on the hacks from previous weeks, one feature that I implemented was an API endpoint that provided data from the r/APStudents reviews on AP classes. I used Pandas to filter through the data. Below are some screenshots of what I have currently:

Another feature that I can implement is using SQLite3 to create some endpoints.
