Collaboration allows people who specialize in different areas to work together to reach an end product. It can involve the combination of the diverse ideas of many people. Skills that are developed through collaboration include: communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, and negotiation. 

Computing innovation: A physical or nonphysical program. Examples include VSCode (nonphysical) or a self driving car (physical).

Collaboration can take place in many formats. Examples include: pair programming (one as driver, one as navigator), think-pair-share (students think through a problem alone, discuss in pairs, then share with class).

Online tools for collaboration: 
* repl.it
* Github
* Shared document/folder

Comments in code also help with communication to yourself and others reading your code.
