# Submission 1 

| Reporting Category   | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function      |  0      | 0| The student did not describe the purpose of the program. This is an interesting point to take note of, because the connotation of <mark>function</mark> and <mark>purpose</mark> are quite similar. However, College Board's standards explain that the *"purpose must address the problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program."*|
| Data Abstraction   | 1      | 1| The student earned the point because two code segments are provided and identifies the list and what is stored in it.|
| Managing Complexity   |   0      | 0| The student did not earn the point for this row simply because the list does not help manage complexity. You can replace the call to the list with a string. Something I learned from the rubric is that **although a list can be used to manage complexity, this does not mean a list = manages complexity. It has to do something that otherwise would be more tedious to implement**|
| Procedural Abstraction| 1        |1| The response earned the point because the procedure (function) and its functionality is described.|
| Algorithm Implementation   | 1        |1| The response earned the point because the algorithm includes sequencing, selection, and iteration, and the algorithm is explained|
| Testing   | 1        |1| The student earned the point by calling the procedure 2 times with different arguments. Both arguments run a different section of the procedure|

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function      |  1     | 1| The student earned the point because the purpose is well stated. It is used as entertainment. Next, the function is also stated, and input and output are explained.|
| Data Abstraction   | 1      | 1| The student earned the point because two code segments are provided and identifies the list and what is stored in it.|
| Managing Complexity   |   1      | 1| The student manages complexity with a list by explaining that the list is used to store 10800 items, which would be very inefficient to do so with variables. |
| Procedural Abstraction| 1        |1| The response earned the point because the procedure (function) and its functionality is described.|
| Algorithm Implementation   | 1        |1| The response earned the point because the algorithm includes sequencing, selection, and iteration, and the algorithm is explained|
| Testing   | 1        |1| The student earned the point by calling the procedure 2 times with different arguments. Both arguments run a different section of the procedure|
