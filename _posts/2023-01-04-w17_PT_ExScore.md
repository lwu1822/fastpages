 •Testing <br> • describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. <br> • describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure. <br> • identifies the result of each call. 
 


# Submission 1 

| Reporting Category   | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Program Purpose and Function      |   0 <br> • Input <br> • Program functionality <br> • Output <br><strong> • describes the overall purpose of the program. </strong> <br> • describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video. <br> • describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video.    | 0| The student did not describe the purpose of the program. This is an interesting point to take note of, because the connotation of <mark>function</mark> and <mark>purpose</mark> are quite similar. However, College Board's standards explain that the *"purpose must address the problem being solved or creative interest being pursued through the program."*|
| Data Abstraction   | 1  <br> includes two program code segments: <br> • one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type). <br> • one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose. <br> • identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response. <br> • describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program.    | 1| The student earned the point because two code segments are provided and identifies the list and what is stored in it.|
| Managing Complexity   |   0  <br> • includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program. <br> <strong>• explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list </strong>   | 0| The student did not earn the point for this row simply because the list does not help manage complexity. You can replace the call to the list with a string. Something I learned from the rubric is that **although a list can be used to manage complexity, this does not mean a list = manages complexity. It has to do something that otherwise would be more tedious to implement**|
| Procedural Abstraction| 1  <br> includes two program code segments: <br> one showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure. <br> one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called. <br> • describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program.      |1| The response earned the point because the procedure (function) and its functionality is described.|
| Algorithm Implementation   | 1   <br>   • includes a program code segment of a student developed algorithm that includes: sequencing, selection, iteration <br>  • explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it.    |1| The response earned the point because the algorithm includes sequencing, selection, and iteration, and the algorithm is explained|
| Testing   | 1  <br> •Testing <br> • describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. <br> • describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure. <br> • identifies the result of each call.       |1| The student earned the point by calling the procedure 2 times with different arguments. Both arguments run a different section of the procedure|

| Program Purpose and Function      |  1 <br> • Input <br> • Program functionality <br> • Output <br> • describes the overall purpose of the program. <br> • describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video. <br> • describes the input and output of the program demonstrated in the video.     | 1| The student earned the point because the purpose is well stated. It is used as entertainment. Next, the function is also stated, and input and output are explained. The input is the keys and mouse clicks. |
| Data Abstraction   | 1  <br> includes two program code segments: <br> • one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type). <br> • one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose. <br> • identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response. <br> • describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program.    | 1| The student earned the point because two code segments are provided and identifies the list and what is stored in it. <br> According to CollegeBoard, the first picture fulfills this row because it shows both accessing elements from the list and storing elements into the list.|
| Managing Complexity   |   1 <br> • includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program. <br> • explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list      | 1| The student manages complexity with a list by explaining that the list is used to store 10800 items, which would be very inefficient to do so with variables.|
| Procedural Abstraction| 1   <br> includes two program code segments: <br> one showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure. <br> one showing where the student-developed procedure is being called. <br> • describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program.       |1| The response earned the point because the procedure (function) and its functionality is described. The first picture displays the function name replaceList, taking in two parameters: current and replacement. The second picture displays the function being called with replaceList.|
| Algorithm Implementation   | 1    <br>   • includes a program code segment of a student developed algorithm that includes: sequencing, selection, iteration <br>  • explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it.     |1| The response earned the point because the algorithm includes sequencing, selection, and iteration, and the algorithm is explained. The selection is due to if else statements which are nested. The iteration occurs with the loop that repeatedly copies the elements of one list to another.|
| Testing   | 1  <br>  •Testing <br> • describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. <br> • describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure. <br> • identifies the result of each call.       |1| The student earned the point by calling the procedure 2 times with different arguments. Both arguments run a different section of the procedure. The replaceList function is called two times with different arguments, 1 and 2, and 2 and 1.|
