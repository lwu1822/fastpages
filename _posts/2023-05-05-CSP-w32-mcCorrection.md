1. The correct answer to #15 is A. I got this question wrong because I did not notice the repeat until loop. Although the second loop will end with i equal to 11, since the repeat until loop uses greater than and equals to, the loop ends when i equals 11.

2. The correct answer to #35 is B. A generalization would find the maximum of all of the values. C is incorrect because it finds the maximum of 4 values, not all possible values. 

3. The correct answer to #45 is D. Out of 8 tries, 2 would be successful, which is why the if loop should be equal to 3 or 0.
