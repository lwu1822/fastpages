# What is the Internet?

The Internet was developed to allow computers to communicate with each other. They do so by sending <mark>packets</mark> that consist of 0s and 1s. The packet includes the <mark>source</mark> and <mark>destination</mark>.

* Computer system: Devices that are used for a similar purpose
* Computer network: Computers that are connected to each other in order to communicate
* Packet switching: The message that the computer sends is broken into many packets. These can be sent in a random order and are put in the original order once they arrive at the destination device. 
* Path: The journey (I couldn't think up of a better word) of a packet from source to destination
* Routing: Routers determine the best path to send a packet from source to destination
* Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be sent in a network
  Units include bits per second

<br>

A <mark>protocol</mark> is the rules that determine how a packet is sent from source to destination. 

There are many <mark>protocol models</mark>, such as <mark> OSI, and TCP/IP</mark>. 

<br>

**TCP/IP model** layers:
* Application: Includes web servers and DNS
  DNS translates an IP address to a web URL that is easy for us to remember
  Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS
* Transport: Protocols: TCP, UDP
  TCP: Slow, but reliable
  UDP: Fast, but unreliable
* Internet: Consists of source and destination IP address, used for transportation of data
  The internet is <mark>scalable</mark>, it includes LANs and WANs
* Network access: Deals with the hardware, associated with getting the information from binary
  Protocols: Ethernet
  NICs (Network interface cards) use the network access protocol and contain a MAC address (used to identify hardware)
