Night at the Museum takes place at the end of every trimester to showcase studentsâ€™ work from various classes. 

The project that I viewed in AP CSP during N@tM is the cat cafe project. The theme of the project was really creative (I might be biased because I like cats :3) and the aesthetics were very pleasing. I played the Purrdle game and left a review on their website.

The other exhibitions that I went to were the 3D Animations classroom and the Photography classroom. 

The picture below is one of the projects I liked the most from the 3D Animations classroom.

This was my favorite photo from the photography class. I liked this photo because of its attention to detail on the orange:
