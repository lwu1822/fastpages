# Program

A program is developed with an idea that aims to follow a purpose. 

Developers need to investigate the issue and be aware of constraints (such as time), pay attention to user concerns. Methods of investigation include surveys or testing. 

Afterwards, developers design the program through brainstorming, creating the user interface, and organizing. 

Prototypes are created, and small parts are created to test each individual parts. 

Last process is to refine. 

Each contributor to the program should be properly credited in the documentation. 

Documentation: An overview of the program that may include functions, events, and other specific aspects of the code.
